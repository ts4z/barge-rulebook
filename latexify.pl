# This script idiosyncratically produces a merged LaTeX document from the
# mdbook SUMMARY.md input by reaching out to all of the links.
#
# This is not a quality product, and it has many, many bugs.
#
# You may think to yourself, "Why not use one of the fine, high-quality
# mdbook-to-latex backends?"  Well, I looked for them, and I tried a couple.
# And I'm pretty disappointed with what you see here.  And yet, here it is.
#
# One problem with this is that it doesn't know how to render tables
# (CommonMark doens't understand tables, and we use it for rendering LaTeX).
# However, you can override any md file by writing a file ending in latex, so
# just do the tables in latex.  We do something similar for the title page,
# since we customize that for both versions.
#
# This seems to work but you are allowed to clean it up.
