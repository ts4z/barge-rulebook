Preface
=======

This rulebook is an update of Christopher J. Mecklin's excellent rulebook from
July 2021.  The rulebook had fallen a bit out of date since it was last
updated.  It was written for the 2021 BARGE tournaments.  Additionally, BARGE
being BARGE, and poker players being poker players, some newer games have been
made up.

This rulebook codifies various poker games that may feature, or may have
featured, at BARGE.  It is not a replacement for the host casino's rulebook, or
the TDA rules, although it does duplicate some of that ground.  It specifically
covers some procedures for some of the things that are unique to BARGE.

This 2024 edition provides a few new games, and a new format that is is
intended to be able to make a more web-accessible version with working
hyperlinks.

Because this was initially reconstructed from the PDF of the 2021 rulebook,
many formatting errors were introduced.  In particular, paragraph breaks were
not maintained well.  Many, but likely not all, have been fixed.  To offset
this, a few formatting errors from the 2021 edition were fixed.  See if you can
find them all!

Improving this Rulebook
-----------------------

Please report errors to [Tim Showalter](mailto:tjs@psaux.com) so we can update
the rulebook.

As of this writing, I'm taking submissions and other corrections for the
rulebook.  The "source code" for the rulebook is now available on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/ts4z/barge-rulebook), including an version history of
changes since the 2024 reconstruction.

I would like to keep this rulebook fairly light, but having more context on
each game would still be welcome.


From the Preface from the 2021 Edition
--------------------------------------

(This section has been slightly edited to stay consistent with the updated
rulebook.)

This document contains the rules of many forms of poker, some of which will be
played in BARGE 2021 tournaments, others in tournaments in past years, and yet
others only in BARGE cash games or home games.

I obtained these rules from a copy of the official rule book for the XXV
25-Game Mix poker tournament played at BARGE XXV in 2015. That rule book was
originally written by Patrick Milligan and Rich Bremer and is reproduced here
with their permission. Also, rules for some of the stranger games came from an
archived version of the BARGE website, called the [BARGE Poker Game Rule
Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20120721203440/http://www.barge.org/rules/).
I have also referred to [Bob Ciaffone’s Robert’s Rules of
Poker](https://www.betsperts.com/poker/robs-poker-rules/)[^1].

[^1]: This link has been updated, as RRP has moved with Bob Ciaffone's passing.

Note that the rule book, unless otherwise noted, is written under the
assumption that the games are being played in a limit format, with a small
betting limit and a large betting limit. Please make appropriate adjustments
when playing that game in the pot-limit or no-limit format.

[A description of the chapters and layout has been removed, since it was out of
date with the updated rulebook.]

This document also includes Appendices explaining the [“Sevens Rule”
(originally written by Michael Weisenberg)](#appendix-b-the-sevens-rule) and
various [Lowball Scales](#appendix-a-lowball-scales) (written by me [Chris
Mecklin]).

Common Rules, Betting Formats, and Variations
=============================================

Limit
-----

In limit poker, also called fixed-limit poker, the size of the raise a player makes is
predetermined by the structure of the game or tournament. The structure will
specify the size of the small bet, the large bet, the small and big blinds for games
that use blinds, and the ante and bring-in for games that use them. It is typical in
modern play for flop and draw variations to use blinds and for stud variations to
use antes and a bring-in. Antes are almost never used in flop or draw variations
played in either the limit or pot-limit format, but are commonly implemented in
conjunction with the blinds in the no-limit format.

As an example, suppose you are playing limit holdem in a tournament at the
100/200 level. This means that the small blind is 50 (typically half the small bet),
the large blind is 100, the small bet is also 100, and the large bet is 200. As this is
a flop game, the small bet limit is used pre-flop and after the flop, and the large
bet limit is used on the turn and river. In a game with only two rounds of action
rather than four, such as California Lowball, the pre-draw action is at the small
bet limit and the post-draw action at the large bet limit.

For a second example, suppose you are playing razz in a tournament at the 200/400
level with a 50 ante and a 75 bring-in. Each player will put in 50 before the first
three cards are dealt and the player with the highest door card is forced to make a
75 bring-in, with an option to instead complete to 200, the full size of the small bet.
The small bet of 200 is used for action on third and fourth streets (two rounds),
while the large bet of 400 is used on fifth, sixth, and seventh street (three rounds
of action). Most stud variations operate on this basis, with the bring-in being
either the player with the highest or lowest door card, depending on the game.

An all-in wager of less than half the bet does not reopen the betting for a player
that has already acted and is in the pot for all previous bets. A player facing less
than half a bet may fold, call, or complete the bet. For example, suppose a player
has made an all-in wager of 100 when the limit is 400. A subsequent player who
has not yet acted may fold, call 100, or complete to 400.
An all-in wager of a half bet or more is treated as as a full bet, and a player may
fold, call, or make a full raise. For example, suppose a player has made an all-in
wager of 300 when the limit is 400. A subsequent player wishing to raise would
make it 300+400=700.

The number of raises that can be made per streeet varies between different poker
rooms. Often a bet and 3 raises is allowed (i.e. it is possible to 4-bet but not to
5-bet); sometimes a bet and 4 raises is allowed. Often the cap on the number of
raises is removed when two players are heads-up in a cash game, but typically not
for a tournament. Check and raise is usually allowed, except in limit California
Lowball.

No-Limit
--------

In no-limit poker, when a player chooses to bet or raise, the size of the raise can
be anywhere from the minimum bet to all-in (i.e. all of the chips the player has in
front of them, or what many of us call the “jam”). The minimum bet will be equal
to the size of the large blind. The minimum raise is the size of the last wager. A
player who wishes to bet or raise but does not have enough chips to make the
minimum wager may go all-in with their remaining chips. Stud variations without
blinds are rarely played in a no-limit format. The minimum bet would be the size
of the bring-in in such a format.

As an example, suppose you are playing no-limit holdem in a tournament at the
100/200 level. Unlike limit, this means that the small blind is 100 and the large
blind is 200. Often each player will also put in an ante; this is commonly done
in later levels of no-limit holdem tournaments. A recent innovation is the big
blind ante, where instead of all players anteing every hand, the players take turns
posting a consolidated ante for the whole table, usually when in the big blind.
Suppose the action folds to the player on the button, who says raise. The minimum
raise in this situation would be 200 (making it 400 to go), and the maximum raise
is all chips the button has. Suppose the button raises 300, making it 500 to go.
The small blind then may fold, call 300, or raise anywhere from 300 (making it
800 to go) to all their chips. Suppose the small blind raises 700, making it 1200 to
go. The big blind’s options would be to fold, call 1000 (i.e. 300+700), or raise a
minimum of 700. Suppose the big blind folds. The button may now either fold,
call 700, or raise a minimum of 700. In our case, the button calls, and a flop is
dealt.

Unlike limit poker, the half bet size rule does not apply to no-limit poker. A player
who has already acted and is not facing a fullsize wager may not subsequently
raise an all-in bet that is less than the minimum bet or less than the full size of
the last bet or raise.

There are an unlimited number of raises available to the players. Check and raise
is allowed.

Pot-Limit
---------
In pot-limit poker, when a player chooses to bet or raise, the size of the raise can
be anywhere from the minimum bet to the size of the pot. The minimum bet
will be equal to the size of the large blind. The minimum raise is the size of the
last bet or raise. A player who wishes to bet or raise but does not have enough
chips to make the minimum wager may go all-in with their remaining chips. Stud
variations without blinds are sometimes played in a pot-limit format, with the
minimum bet being the size of the bring-in.

For an example, suppose you are playing in a pot-limit Omaha tournament at the
100/200 level. Unlike limit and like no-limit, this means that the small blind is 100
and the large blind is 200. Suppose the action folds to the player on the button,
who says raise. The minimum raise in this situation would be 200 (making it 400
to go), and the maximum raise would be the size of the pot. As the first player
to act pre-flop, the pot size will be 3.5 times the big blind (i.e. 7 times the small
blind), so the maximum raise is to make it 700 (a raise of 500). This assumes that
the first action is prior to the small blind, both blinds are posted, and that the
small blind is exactly half the big blind. Suppose the cut-off makes it 500, a raise
of 300. The button says pot. The pot-sized bet will be 3L + T, where L (the last
wager, by the button) is L = 500 and the trail T = 300 (the blinds), Here, that
will be equal to 3*500 + 300 =1800, so the button makes it 1800 to go, a raise of
1300.

For a second example, suppose you are playing a pot-limit London Lowball (i.e. Ace-to-Six razz) 
tournament where the ante is 100 and the bring-in is 150. With eight
players, the size of the pot is 8 ∗ 100 + 150 = 950. Player A brings it in for 150.
Player B says raise. The minimum raise Player B can make is 150 (the size of the
bring-in), to 300, and the maximum raise is 950 + 150 = 1100, to 1250 (call 150 +
raise of 1100). Suppose Player B raised 500, to 650, and Player C says pot. The
pot-sized bet will be 3L + T, where L (the last wager, by Player B) is L = 650,
the trail T (the bring-in by Player A and the antes) is T = 950, so the pot-sized
bet is to 3 ∗ 650 + 950 = 2900, a raise of 2250. Notice that if we used 3L + T for
Player B, we get 3 ∗ 150 + 800 = 1250, a raise of 1100, as we got before.
Unlike limit poker, the half bet size rule does not apply to pot-limit poker. A player
who has already acted and is not facing a fullsize wager may not subsequently
raise an all-in bet that is less than the minimum bet or less than the full size of
the last bet or raise.

There are an unlimited number of raises available to the players. Check and raise
is allowed.

Ties & Odd Chips
----------------

When the situation arises where a pot needs to be split, such as in a split-pot game
or when two or more players tie for the winning hand, it is often the case that
there will be an odd chip or chips that will need to be assigned. The conventions
for splitting pots and dealing with odd chips are largely taken from 
[the TDA rules](https://www.pokertda.com/view-poker-tda-rules/). The pertinent sections are
General Concepts 20 and 21.

1. An odd chip is broken down into the smallest denomination in play.
2. No player may receive more than one off chip.
3. When two or more hands tie, an odd chip or chips are awarded as follows: 
   a. In games with a button, the first hand clockwise from the button (i.e. “worst
      position”) gets the odd chip; 
   b. In stud games, the odd chip will be given to
      the hand with the highest card by suit, where the ordering of suits is spades,
      hearts, diamonds, clubs; 
   c. In High-Low split games, the high hand receives
      the odd chip in a split between the high and low hands.
      
Some split-pot games that are not High-Low in the traditional sense are not
explicitly covered in the TDA rules. Here is how odd chips will be assigned.

* In split games that involve a five-card hand and a four-card hand, the
  fivecard hand is treated as the high hand. Examples of such games include
  Badacey, Badeucy, Razzdugi, and Action Razzdugi. For instance, an odd chip in
  Badacey would be awarded to the player with the best A-5 lowball hand, not
  the best badugi hand.

* In split pot games that involve a draw hand, where the player uses all five
  cards in their hand, and an Omaha hand, where the player uses two cards
  in their hand and three cards from the board, the draw hand is treated
  as the high hand. Examples of such games include Dramaha, Triple-Draw
  Dramaha, and Dramaha 49. For instance, an odd chip in Dramaha 49 would
  be awarded to the player with the best draw point value hand, not the best
  Omaha high hand.

* In Sohe (Simultaneous Omaha and Hold’em), where the players split a six-card
  hand into a four-card part used for Omaha and a two-card part used for
  Hold’em, the Omaha hand is treated as the high hand.

For any unusual situations that are not explicitly covered, the decision of the
tournament floor person would be final. The tournament staff will likely use
TDA Recommended Procedure 14 (RP-14), which states that “randomness may be
applied to special situations”.

Big Blind Ante
--------------

Traditionally in no-limit Texas Hold’em tournaments, the blind structure used
was that two players posted blinds (the small blind and big blind) each hand.
Additionally, most tournaments featured an ante that would be posted by each
player before every hand, typically starting a few levels into the tournament. This
is done to further drive the action by increasing the amount of chips and thus the
incentive to enter the pot.

One of the disadvantages of having every player make an individual ante is time,
in terms of having the dealer gather up the antes, make change, remind forgetful
players to ante, and to deal with disagreements about unposted antes.

In the 2010s, a new idea known as the **big blind ante** was introduced in
tournament poker and quickly became the standard, where the player in the big
blind would post an ante for the entire table. One should think of the big
blind ante as a shared ante that all players take turn in paying rather than an
extra “penalty” for being in the big blind. The reason why the big blind ante
is not assigned to another position, such as the button, is that every hand
will have a player in the big blind but sometimes there will be a dead button.

Some controversies about the big blind ante include: (a) how large should it
be; (b) should the size of the big blind ante be reduced in short-handed
situations; and (c) how should the situation be handled where the player in the
big blind does not have sufficient chips to post both the ante and the big
blind. One should always consult the structure sheet and/or the tournament
director to verify how any particular tournament is handling the big
blind. Here, we describe how the big blind ante was handled at BARGE 2020,
keeping in mind that this might change in the future.

The size of the big blind ante was equal to the size of the small blind for a
six-handed tournament, and was equal to the size of the big blind for a full ring
(nine or ten-handed) tournament. The size of the big blind ante was NOT reduced
in the full ring tournament when tables became short-handed. A player with
insufficient chips to post both the big blind ante and the big blind would post the
ante first. For example, suppose a player has T18000 remaining with a big blind
of T10000 in a full ring tournament. This player would first post T10000 as the
ante and his last T8000 as an incomplete big blind. If the player had only T8000
left, they would post all of it into the ante and nothing into the big blind, and in
this situation the best case scenario for that player would be to win the hand and
get the T8000 back.

Bomb Pot
--------
The **bomb pot** is a variation of a no-limit Texas Hold’em tournament used at
BARGE starting in a 2021 tournament. In this variation, all players post an
ante pre-flop, and there is no pre-flop betting. Instead, the three-card flop
is dealt and action commences with the player to the left of the button. The
minimum bet size is the size of the ante. Otherwise, play is as normal for
no-limit Texas Hold’em. A button is still used and rotated around the table to
determine the player that will be first to act on each betting round.

Bounty
------
A **bounty** in a tournament is a prize that is won by eliminating a player. In a
split-pot game, the bounty is typically awarded to the winner of the high hand/fivecard hand portion. In a chopped pot, the bounty winner will be the player in
worst position. At BARGE 2021, bounties will be used in the No Limit California
Lowball tournament as a “green chip” ($25) bounty per player. The winner of the
tournament keeps their bounty.

Jam-or-Fold
-----------

**Jam-or-Fold** is a variation of a poker tournament where the player has only two
options for their initial action. They can either go all-in (“jam”) or fold.

Lammers
-------

**Lammers** are re-buy chips that players receive at the beginning of a tournament,
and at BARGE is most usually used in the Pot-Limit Omaha event. Players
may turn in any or all of their lammers before the start of the hand to receive
tournament chips equal to the assigned value of the lammers. Players may not
redeem lammers during the play of a hand. When a player busts but has remaining
lammers, they must use at least one lammer before the next hand.

Here are some examples of hypothetical lammer usage, based on the structure of
the 2020 BARGE PLO event. Players received T10000 in chips and two lammers
worth T5000 chips each. One possibility is to immediately redeem both lammers
before the first hand is dealt, thus starting with a T20000 stack. However, when
this player busts they are out of the tournament. Another possibility is that when a
player busts, they can redeem one of the two lammers to have T5000. Yet
another possibility is that a player, reduced to a T2000 stack, can 
redeem one lammer to increase their stack size to T7000.

Players are required to redeem all remaining lammers after a certain level,
which was Level 12 at BARGE 2020. This is done to prevent players from holding
onto lammers until deep in the tournament, at which point the value of the
lammers compared to the size of the blinds is so small that such a player would
be best served by folding every hand and trying to “farm” up the payout
schedule.

Shootout
--------
A shootout is a tournament where instead of having the number of tables gradually
reduced by breaking tables and moving players to replace eliminated players, each
table players down to a single winner, and those winners advance to play each
other. In a large enough tournament, there could be several levels. As an example,
a six-handed shootout tournament could start with 216 (which is 6³) players at
36 tables, with the 36 table winners advancing to a second round of 6 tables, and
those winner advancing to a final table of six. Typically some tables will have one
few player if the number of entrants isn’t a perfect square or cube. For example,
suppose 75 players enter a nine-handed shootout tournament. Since 81 players (9²)
would accomodate exactly 9 nine-handed tables, with table winners advancing to
a final table, in this case six of the nine tables would start with one fewer player.

Sometimes at BARGE shootouts have been played such that the final two players
from each table advance to the next round, rather than just a single player.

Short Deck
----------
**Short Deck**, also referred to as a “stripped deck”, is when certain
denominations of cards are removed, leaving a smaller deck. The most common
such variation is when a deck of 36 cards is used, where all of the deuces,
treys, fours, and fives have been removed, leaving a deck with sixes, sevens,
eights, nines, tens, Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Aces in the four suits. Refer to
the rule pages for Short Deck Texas Hold’em and Short Deck Omaha, as there are
some changes to the rank of hands made for combinatorial reasons.

Another variation, used in Mexican poker, is to remove the eights, nines, and tens
from the deck and to add a single joker, leaving a deck of 41 cards. Refer to the
rule page for Mexican Poker for further details in the play of this variation.

Win The Button
---------------
**Win The Button** is a variation of a poker tournament where the player who
wins the hand receives the button for the subsequent hand. Thus, the button does
not rotate as typical and players can end up paying (or not paying) blinds several
hands in a row. If there is a chopped pot won by two or more players, the winning
player in the worst position on that hand receives the button for the next hand.
This variation is typically not used in split-pot games.

Dice Procedures
---------------

A few games involve the players rolling dice in order to influence the game.
In these games, the dice (or die) are rolled by the player on the button. Dice
must land flush on the table having traveled at least the distance to the far
side of the dealer’s box.

Dice must tumble.  They may not be slid.

The dealer is responsible for calling a valid or invalid roll.

Traditionally, there is a price to be paid for not rolling the dice properly.
Experienced BARGE players will explain current tipping procedure.

Stud Procedures
---------------

In all stud games, it is required of each player that they do not alter or
obfuscate the order in which they have received their up cards.

Lowball
-------

Lowball has several variants, discussed in the appendix on [Lowball
Scales](#appendix-a-lowball-scales).

Poker Variants
==============

Poker variants are listed here alphabetically, including both well-known
(Hold'em) and less well known (Bidrectional Chowaha).  Of course, some of the
names are surprising (Chowaha is not next to Four-Card Chowaha) but they are
still alphabetized.

There are a lot of games here.  Historically at BARGE, [Chowaha](#chowaha) is quite
popular, and the Pot-Limit [Binglaha](#binglaha) game has been known to run very late on
Saturday night.

Mixed games based around HORSE are mainstays, particularly with something
substituting out for [Razz](#razz). One variant is HOSER, which sometimes means
Razz is gone and [Action Razz](#action-razz) is in its place.

Oklahoma appears to be popular with dealers for a reason that the "cash game"
rule should make clear.

Ace-to-Five Triple Draw
-----------------------

### Forced Money
The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Each player in turn discards zero to five cards from their hand. Once all of the
discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. This is followed by a round of betting at the small
bet limit.

Then there is a second draw, followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit.

This is followed by a third draw, followed by a round of betting a the big bet limit.

This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card California lowball hand wins the pot.

NOTE: This game is usually played limit, but is sometimes played as a pot-limit
game. It is not played with a joker/bug.

Action Razz
-----------
### Forced Money
The game is played with antes. The high card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in. The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by the K♥, K♦,
K♣, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure
Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. Action starts with the lowest hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown
The best five-card California low hand wins the pot, but with the provision that a
player must have at least one face card (Jack, Queen, or King) among their seven
cards to qualify. 

A hand that qualifies is called a “Face” hand, while a hand that does not
qualify is called a “Butt” hand. It is not necessary to play a face card in the
best five-card California low hand, but any hand containing a face card defeats
any hand without a face card.

As an extreme example, the hand A♥ 2♥ 3♠ 4♣ 5♦ 6♠ 7♣, which would be the nuts
in razz as it is typically played, would lose to K♥ K♦ K♠ K♣ Q♦ Q♠ Q♣, which
would be the nut low in typical razz. The first player has a “Butt” Five, while
the second player has a “Face” Queens full of Kings.

If two or more players reach showdown and none of the players have a face card,
then the winner is determined based on the best five-card California low hand
(i.e. just like typical razz).

A more realistic example is shown in the following hand, with three players at
showdown.

* Player 1: 2♥ 2♦ 3♠ 3♣ 4♦ 5♠ 7♣
* Player 2: A♥ A♦ 2♠ 4♣ 4♥ 6♠ 8♣
* Player 3: 3♥ 5♦ 7♠ 8♦ 9♥ Q♠ K♣

Player 3 wins with their “Face” Nine, 98753. If there was a side pot between
Player 1 and Player 2, Player 1’s “Butt” Seven, 75432 would beat Player 2’s “Butt”
Eight, 8642A.

### Notes

Action Razz is a creation of Kevin Un.

It is believed that the origination of the the terms “Face” and “Butt” for
qualifying and non-qualifying hands in Action Razz is due to Cliff Matthews,
when he was coding the game and needed to evaluate the razz hands with the
addition of the face card qualifier.

Action Razzdugi
---------------

### Forced Money
The game is played with antes. The high card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in. The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by the K♥, K♦,
K♣, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure
Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.
A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. Action starts with the lowest hand showing.
A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.
A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.
A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card Action Razz hand (refer to the rules of Action Razz to see how
this differs from standard razz) and the best (ace-to-four) badugi hand splits the
pot. A face card is not required to win the badugi hand. There is no qualifier for
either the action razz or badugi hand. If there is no four-card badugi hand, the
best three-card hand wins half the pot.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Each player in turn discards zero to five cards from their hand. Once all of the
discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. This is followed by a round of betting at the small

Then there is a second draw, followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit.

This is followed by a third draw, followed by a round of betting a the big bet limit.

This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card high hand and California low hand splits the pot. A player must
have a pair of sixes or better to qualify for the high hand and eight or better to
qualify for the low hand. In the case where no player qualifies in either direction,
the high hand, even though it is weaker than a pair of sixes, scoops the pot.

### Notes

Sometimes the qualifier for high hand is a pair of nines rather than a pair of
sixes.

The rules for London Lowball were written assuming the game is played
pot-limit, which is traditional for this game as described in Pot-Limit & No-Limit
Poker by Stewart Reuben and Bob Ciaffone and how it was played at BARGE
2018. It is not played with a joker/bug.

Mexican Poker
-------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with antes and a button which rotates clockwise after each
hand. 

### Dealing Procedure

The player with the high card showing clockwise of the dealer button goes
first. A Joker dealt face-up is considered to be an ace for the purposes of the high
hand.

A deck of 41 cards is used, where all of the eights, nines, and tens have been
removed and a single Joker has been added. A Joker that is dealt face up serves as
a bug and can be used either as an Ace or to complete a straight or flush. A Joker
that is dealt face down serves as a completely wild card and assumes any value to
make the player’s best possible five-card poker hand. A Joker that is dealt face
down and exposed by a player is still a completely wild card, rather than a bug.

Starting with the player to the left of the button, each player is dealt one card
face down then one card up. The player with the high card makes a bet, at either
the small or large betting limit, followed by a round of betting. All raises must be
at least equal to the size of the last bet.

After the betting round is complete, each remaining player has to decide whether
or not to expose their down card.

A third card is dealt to each player. The card is dealt face down if both of the
player’s cards have been exposed, otherwise it is dealt face up. This is followed
by a round of betting, starting with the player with the highest hand showing
clockwise of the dealer button.
After the betting round is complete, each remaining player has to decide whether
or not to expose their down card.

A fourth card is dealt to each player. The card is dealt face down if all of the
player’s cards have been exposed, otherwise it is dealt face up. This is followed
by a round of betting, starting with the player with the highest hand showing
clockwise of the dealer button.

After the betting round is complete, each remaining player has to decide whether
or not to expose their down card.

A fifth card is dealt to each player. The card is dealt face down if all of the player’s
cards have been exposed, otherwise it is dealt face up. This is followed by a round
of betting, starting with the player with the highest hand showing clockwise of
the dealer button.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high five-card poker hand wins the pot. Since the stripped deck of 41
cards is being used, a flush will outrank a full house. Because the eights, nines,
and tens have been removed, a hand such as 5-6-7-J-Q is a straight.

Mississippi Stud/Stud High-Low Eight-or-Better/Razz
---------------------------------------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting, starting with the player to the left of
the big blind (as is usual for games with blinds). For all rounds, the minimum bet
will be equal to the size of the big blind and the minimum raise is the size of the
last bet or raise. The maximum wager is the size of the pot.

Two up cards are dealt to each player in the way stud up cards are dealt, that is,
starting in seat 1. This is followed by a round of betting. The betting is initiated
by the best high poker hand showing for stud and stud high-low eight-or-better.
The betting is initiated by the best low poker hand for razz.

A fourth up card is dealt to all players. This is followed by a round of betting. The
best high poker hand on the board leads the betting for stud and stud high-low
eight-or-better. The betting is initiated by the best low poker hand for razz.

A fifth up card is dealt to all players. This is followed by a round of betting
starting with the best high poker hand on the board for stud and stud high-low
eight-or-better. The betting is initiated by the best low poker hand for razz.
If there are not enough cards in the stub to deal every remaining player a card, a
single community card is dealt instead.

It is required of each player that they not alter or obfuscate the order in which
they have received their up cards.

### Evaluating the Showdown

In Mississipi Stud, the best high five-card hand wins the pot.

In Mississippi Stud High-Low, the pot is split between
the best high five-card hand and the best California low hand with an 8 qualifier.
(If there is no low hand, the high hand scoops.)

In Mississippi Razz, the best five-card California low hand wins the pot
(without a qualifier).

### Notes
The rules for Mississippi Stud were written assuming the game is played
pot-limit, with blinds.

The game was designed by David Zanetti to be a version of stud more amenable to
a big-bet format than standard seven-card stud. See [this entry from the old
RGP
FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20150907103507/http://www.rgpfaq.com/mississippi-stud.html).


Murder
------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit. Two columns of three cards each (X) are placed in the center of
the table as the flop. There is a round of betting at the lower limit.

A third column of three community cards (Y) are placed face up. This is followed
by a round of betting at the big bet limit.

A fourth column of three community cards (Z) are placed face up. This is followed
by a round of betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.
The final board will look like this:

```
X X Y Z
X X Y Z
X X Y Z
```

All the X cards are placed on the board on the flop, the Y cards on the turn, and
the Z cards on the river.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high hand and the best California low hand with an 8-or-better qualifier
split the pot. As in Omaha, hands are made using exactly two cards from each
player’s hand and exactly three cards from the board to form each portion of their
hand. When forming a hand (high or low), each player may use only one card
from each row on the board! Separate hand and board cards may be used by each
player to create their high and low hands.

### Notes

Warning! Given the number of cards in a player’s hand, the number of possible
combinations of cards that may be used from the board, the fact that the game is
split pot, and the fact that each hand must be formed using only one card present
in each row of the board cards, evaluating hands can be especially tricky.

Oklahoma
--------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three flops are dealt one above the other forming a 3 × 3 square of cards. This is
followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.
Three turn cards (one for each flop) are placed on the board, lined up vertically to
the right of the flops (forming a 3 × 4 grid). This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.
A fifth column of three additional community cards are placed face up. At this
point, the board will look like the following:

```
X1 X1 X1 Y1 Z1
X2 X2 X2 Y2 Z2
X3 X3 X3 Y3 Z3
```

All the X cards are placed on the board on the flop, the Y cards on the turn, and
the Z cards on the river.

Next, the horizontal row of cards (board) with the lowest river card by rank is
removed from play. The deuce is the lowest rank and the Ace is the highest rank
for card removal. If two river cards share the same lowest rank, then both are
removed. If all three river cards share the same rank, no boards are removed. In
this way, “tournament” Oklahoma differs from “cash game” Oklahoma, where all
three boards are removed and the dealer wins the pot.

For example, if Z1, Z2, and Z3 are the 3♥, 8♠, and 3♣ respectively, then all of
the cards on both row 1 and row 3 are removed. Board removal is followed by a
round of betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown
The best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or better
splits the pot. Hands are made using exactly two cards from each player’s hand
and exactly three cards from one of the remaining boards. A player may use
different cards for their low and high hand, and they may use different boards for
their low and high hand.

-----------------

### Forced Money

cards from each player’s hand and exactly three cards from the board.

### Notes

This game is most commonly played as pot-limit (PLO), but is sometimes played
as a limit game.  Most limit games, however, are
[Omaha/8](#omaha-highlow-eight-or-better).

Omaha High/Low Eight-or-Better
------------------------------

Omaha High/Low Eight-or-Better is frequently abbreviated to Omaha/8 or O/8.

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown
The best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or better
splits the pot. Hands are made using exactly two cards from each player’s hand
and exactly three cards from the board. Note: If there are not three unpaired
cards eight or lower on the board, no low hand is possible. If no qualifying low
hand is made, the high hand scoops the pot.

### Notes

Both limit (O8) and pot-limit versions (PLO8) of this game are popular.

Omaha X or Better
-----------------

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

At this point two (standard) dice are rolled, in accordance with the [Dice
Procedures](#dice-procedures).  These determine "X", the qualifier for the low
hand:

* 12 = Queen
* 11 = Jack
* 10 down to 5: face value
* 4, 3, or 2: no low hand

One additional community card is place faced up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

Hands are made using exactly two cards from each player’s hand and exactly
three cards from the board.  The pot is split between the best conventional
high hand and the best low hand, with a qualifier of X (the die roll).

If no qualifying low hand is made, the high hand always scoops the pot.

If the board does not have three cards under X on the board, no low is possible
(thus a die roll of 2, 3, or 4 rules out a low hand).

### Notes

This game was created by Christian "Dr. Doofenschmirtz" Jones.

Paradise Road Pick’em
---------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.


### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt three cards. The player under the gun determines whether the
hand will be played as Hold’em, Omaha High/Low Eight-or-Better, Razz, Stud,
or Stud High/Low Eight-or-Better (i.e. the HORSE games). When heads-up or
three-handed, the player with the button will choose the game for that hand. If
the under the gun player is absent from the table or otherwise cannot or will not
choose a game, the default game to be played is Hold’em.

If Hold’em is selected, each player must discard one card. If Omaha/8 is selected,
each player is dealt an additional card. The hand then plays out as the selected
game, with action beginning with the player under the gun.

If Razz, Stud, or Stud High/Low is selected, each player will in turn (with action
beginning with the player under the gun) either fold, call, or raise. If they call or
raise they will expose (i.e. roll) a door card of their choice at that time.

For stud variations, on fourth street and beyond the cards will be dealt starting at
the dealer’s left and the betting action will start with the player with the high or
low hand, as appropriate for the variation being played. The small bet will be the
size of the big blind and the big bet will be double the size of the big blind. For
example, if the blinds are 50/100, then the small bet of 100 is used on 3rd and 4th
streets and the big bet of 200 is used on 5th, 6th, and 7th streets.

Please refer to rules of the individual game for further details on dealing procedure
and evaluating the showdown.

Triple Draw Dramaha
-------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. Each player in turn discards zero to
five cards from their hand. Once all of the discards have been announced, the

Dramaha, where the draw takes place AFTER the flop betting.

One additional community card is placed face up. Each player in turn discards
zero to five cards from their hand. Once all of the discards have been announced,
the dealer will deal each player an appropriate number of replacement cards. This
is followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit.

Two or Five Omaha High/Low Eight-or-Better
------------------------------------------

### Forced Money

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or better
splits the pot. Hands are made using either exactly two cards from each player’s
hand and exactly three cards from the board or using all five cards in each player’s
hand, whichever produces the superior hand. A player may use all five cards in
one direction and use only two cards in the other. If no qualifying low hand is
made, the high hand scoops the pot.

Example: One player is dealt A♥ Q♥ J♥ T♥ 2♥. The board is 3♠ 5♥ 7♣ K♥ Q♦.

The player plays the A♥ 2♥ from their hand to make a 7532A low, and all five
cards from their hand to make a ace-queen high flush.

Note that this player does not have the nut low, as it is possible that another
player holds a five card hand that makes a better California low hand than
7532A.

==========================

Badugi
------
In this game, a badugi is defined as a four-card hand that contains no pairs and
no repeated suits (i.e. “rainbow”). The best hand in most badugi games is 432A
rainbow. In badeucy, which is a split-pot game based on badugi and deuce-to-seven
triple draw, the game is modified so that 5432 rainbow is the best badugi, in order
to make a "nut-nut” hand possible in that game.

The weakest badugi hand is KQJT rainbow. It would beat any non-badugi hand.
If no one makes a badugi, the best three card hand wins. The best three-card is
32A rainbow. If two players have the same three-card, the fourth card is NOT
used. For instance, if Player A has 7♠ 3♠ 2♥ A♦ and Player B has 3♣ 3♦ 2♠
A♥, they would split the pot with 32A. If Player A has 7♠ 4♣ 2♥ 2♦, they have
742 and beat Player B with 7♦ 5♣ A♥ A♦, which is a 75A. If no one has a
three-card hand, then best two-card hand is used, and so on.

California Lowball, aka Ace-to-Five or A-5
------------------------------------------

In California Lowball, 5432A is the best hand, often called the “wheel”. Aces count
low, straights and flushes DO NOT count against for evaluation of the best lowball
hand. Think of your hand as a five-digit number with the Ace being a one.
If all players at showdown are paired, the lowest pair would win. For example,
AA765 would beat 22543. If players have the same pair, then the lowest remaining
part of the hand would win. So AA654 would beat AA732.

If the joker/bug is being used, it is used as the lowest card that does not pair any
other card held. If you held 653A-Joker, you would use the Joker as a deuce and
your hand would be 6532A.

This scale is used in California Lowball, Badacey, Hold’em High/Low
Eight-orBetter, Omaha Eight-or-Better, Binglaha, Oklahoma, 2 or 5 Omaha
Eight-or Better, 4 Card Chowaha Eight-or-Better, Razz, Razzdugi, Stud
Eight-or-Better, and Stud High/Low No Qualifier.

In most split pot games played with the California Lowball scale, an
Eight-orBetter is needed to qualify for the low hand. If no player has an
Eight-or-Better, then the high hand will scoop the pot. The worst lowball hand
that will qualify in Eight-or-Better is 87654.

California Lowball, Badacey, Razz, Razzdugi, and Stud High/Low No Qualifier
do not use Eight-or-Better in evaluation of the low hand. California Lowball
traditionally uses the “Sevens Rule” (see Appendix B) with no check and raise
allowed.

Kansas City Lowball, a.k.a. Deuce-to-Seven or 2-7
---------------------------------------
In Kansas City Lowball, 75432 (not single suited) is the best hand, also often
called the “wheel”. Aces count high, straights and flushes DO count against for
evaluation of the best lowball hand. Again, think of your hand as a five-digit
number, but the Ace is no longer a one and straights/flushes are bad.

Note that A5432 is NOT a straight in deuce-to-seven. It is a perfect Ace high (see
Section A.4) and would beat all other ace-low hands and any paired hand.

Again, if all players at showdown are paired, the lowest pair would win. But 22543
would beat AA765, as 22 is the lowest pair and AA the highest pair. If somehow
all players remaining have a straight, the lowest straight wins. 76543 would beat
87654. Similarly, if all players remaining have a flush, the lowest flush wins. 86543
flush would beat 95432 flush. The joker/bug is rarely used; if it is used, it is used
as the lowest card that makes a low hand. For example, if you held 6543-Joker,
you would use the Joker as an eight and your hand would be 86543. You would
not use the Joker as either a deuce or seven because in this case, either of those
ranks would make a straight.

This scale is used in Deuce-to-Seven Triple Draw, Badeucy, and Deuce-to-Seven
Razz. Check and raise is allowed and no analog of the “Sevens Rule” exists.

Another common game with this scale is No Limit Deuce-to-Seven Lowball, played
with a single draw. Traditionally, players must enter the pot for at least a minimum
raise in this game (i.e. no limping is allowed).

London Lowball, aka Ace-to-Six or A-6
--------------------------------

This variation is seldom seem in games played in American casinos. It is similar
to California Lowball in that the Ace is low, but unlike California Lowball and
similar to Kansas City Lowball in that straights and flushes count against you.
The best hand is 6432A (not single suited).

Probably the most common game that uses it is called “London Lowball”, which
is razz played with the Ace-to-Six scale and usually played pot limit rather than
fixed limit. This version made its BARGE debut in 2018.

Smooth Hands/Rough Hands/Perfect Hands
--------------------------------

You will often hear words such as smooth, rough, or perfect used in describing a
lowball hand. Let’s consider California lowball as an example. A smooth seven
would be a seven-high hand that is one of the lowest sevens, for example 7543A.
The “smoothest” seven is called a perfect seven, which would be 7432A. Conversely,
a rough hand is one of the highest sevens, such as 76432. The “roughest” seven
would be 76543.

Here’s a Kansas City lowball example: 85432 is the perfect eight. 86432 would
be described as a smooth eight, and sometimes even a hand like 87432 would be
described as a smooth eight-seven. A hand like 87642 is a rough eight. Note that
87654 is not a rough eight, but a straight that would be an extremely poor hand!
It is up to debate at what point a hand is no longer smooth but is now rough.

Rank of Lowball Hands
---------------------

In lowball, it is traditional to speak of strong hands as “Number #x”. For example,
if a player announces their hand as “Number #4” (i.e. the fourth best possible
hand), in California Lowball they would have 6542A, and in Kansas City Lowball
76542. Of course, in the table below the hand cannot be single-suited (a flush)
to qualify in either Deuce-to-Seven or Ace-to-Six. Notice the Ace-to-Six hands
are obtained merely by subtracting one from each “digit” of the corresponding
Deuce-to-Seven hand.

Notice in Ace-to-Five there is one five (the wheel or nuts), 5 sixes, and 15 sevens,
for a total of 21 hands that are a seven-or-better (i.e. where the “Sevens Rule”
would apply). There are 35 eights, so a total of 56 hands that are Eight-or-Better.
In Deuce-to-Seven, there are four sevens, 14 eights, and 34 nines, for a total of 52
hands that are nine-or-better. Number #53 is the perfect ten, in case Bill Chen
quizzes you. The same is true in Ace-to-Six; again, merely subtract one from each
of these ranks.

Appendix B: The “Sevens Rule”
=============================

_From Michael Wiesenberg’s “Go For Low” column in Card Player Magazine_

Most California cardrooms have something called the sevens rule. After the draw,
you must bet a 7 or better whenever you are either first to bet, or those ahead of
you have passed. If you do not, you cannot win any action after the draw, and, in
some clubs, you forfeit the entire pot. Of course, if you have a 7 or better and
someone bets ahead of you, you can throw the hand away if you do not think it
will win.

Strictly speaking, you can pass a 7 or better after the draw, and then call with it.
If you do, though, all you can do is lose. Here’s why. If someone bets after you,
and hers is a worse hand (and you call), the rules let her remove her money from
the pot. If hers is the better hand, however, and you call, your money stays in
the pot. In those few clubs in which you lose the entire pot by passing a 7, if you
inadvertently make the mistake of passing, just quietly throw your cards away.
Don’t make a fuss. They won’t change the rules just for you.

There actually are an extremely few instances in which it is mathematically
sound to pass and then call with a 7 (because you lose less than if you bet). An
explanation of when you can profitably do so is way beyond the scope of the early
part of this series. I mention it only because renowned poker theoretician David
Sklansky has written about when to make the play. For all practical purposes,
however, if you just assume that it is never correct to pass and call with a 7 or
better, particularly in no-limit lowball, you won’t make many mistakes.
Players are likely to inadvertently pass 7s (or better) in two situations:

1. A new player gets flustered and forgets the rule. He passes without thinking.
   Sometimes he remembers the rule before the next player has acted, and tries
   to un-pass, with some such remark as, “I forget about that sevens rule. Can
   I make a bet now?” Sometimes he remembers after the next player has acted,
   often after the next player has already passed, and now when he tries to bet,
   an argument ensues. No matter how it happens, however, he gives away his
   hand, and chills the after-the-draw action.
2. A player draws several cards, usually three or more, and passes without
   looking at her cards, unconsciously concluding that she could not possibly
   make a 7 or better drawing that many cards. Of course, the time she passes
   blind is often the time she makes that miracle draw. What often happens is
   that she ends up losing money, because someone would have called a bet.

There are two obvious countermeasures for these situations.

The first is always be aware of the sevens rule. Remember that it is in force
in almost every California cardroom that has lowball. Be aware of what your
hand is when it is your turn to act, and don’t pass if you have a 7 or better.

The second is, when you take multiple cards, don’t pass blind; don’t assume
that you can’t possibly make a hand. Look at your cards and, again, if you
have a 7 or better, bet.

How the sevens rule comes into effect when you call an all-in bet that is less than a
full bet: You can inadvertently run afoul of the sevens rule in the following way. If
someone makes a bet in turn that is less than a full bet, and you just call (rather
than completing the bet) with a 7 or better, and someone calls or raises behind
you, that person gets his bet back (unless he has you beat, of course).

Example: The limit is $20. Four players call, so the pot now contains $80. (For
simplicity, lets assume that three of the players are the blinds.) After the draw,
John, directly to the left of the button, has only $15 left, which he bets. You, on
the big blind, who drew two cards, got lucky and made a wheel. You don’t want to
scare either of the two remaining players, so you just call, knowing that you can’t
win any more from John. Cindy, who had originally opened the pot and was pat,
says, “I complete the bet”, and puts in $20. Henry, on the button, who had drawn
one card, now raises, by putting in $40. A side pot is created. The bet skips John,
who is out of chips. You say, “I raise”, and someone at the table informs you that
since check-raising is not permitted in limit poker, all you can do is call.

Cindy, though, reraises, and Henry just calls the bet. You call the extra bet. The
hands are shown. John made an 8−4−3−2−A, and is out of contention. You
show your wheel 5−4−3−2−A, and start to reach for the pot. Cindy shows a
6−4−3−2−A and Henry shows 6−5−4−3−2. The house dealer pushes all
of Cindy’s and Henry’s post-draw betting back to them, and pushes the center pot
to you, consisting of that initial $80, plus the $30 that constitutes the $15 that
John bet and you called. You don’t win the extra $120 that Cindy and Henry put
in, because what you did is a violation of the sevens rule. Had you completed the
bet, by putting in an extra $5 with your $15, you would have won a lot more.

So here’s what to remember. If someone goes all in ahead of you and that bet is
less than a full bet, be sure to complete the bet if you have a 7 or better. That is,
put enough into the pot to turn your call into as much as the limit of the game.
Of course, there’s nothing to stop you from completing the bet even if you have
worse.

The same thing holds in no-limit lowball. If someone goes all in ahead of you and
that bet is less than the minimum bet for the game, be sure to complete the bet if
you have a 7 or better. So, for example, if the blinds were $5-$5-$10, the minimum
bet would be $20. If after the draw the player ahead of you goes all in for $15 and
you have a pat wheel and at least one player remains behind you, make sure to
put in at least $20. Since its a no-limit game, you can of course put in as much
more as you like.

Appendix C: What Beats What
===========================

No list of poker rules is complete without yet another regurgitation of
standard poker hand order.

Standard order is as follows:

* Straight Flush, five cards in sequence in the same suit (2♣3♣4♣5♣6♣)
* Four of a Kind, a.k.a. Quads, four cards of the same rank + a kicker (e.g.,
  8♠8♥8♣8♦J♠)
* Full House, a.k.a. Full Boat, House, three cards of the same rank, then two
  cards of a different rank (7♣7♠7♦2♥2♦)
* Flush, five cards in the same suit (A♥K♥9♥7♥6♥)
* Straight, five cards in sequence of more than one suit (5♣6♦7♦8♠9♦)
* Three of a Kind, a.k.a. Trips (6♣6♦6♥A♥K♠)
* Two Pair, such as two aces and two eights with some other card as a kicker
* One Pair, (e.g., 5♥5♠7♣8♣9♣)
* High Card, a.k.a. Nothing (2♠3♠4♦5♣7♥ or A♥K♥Q♥J♥2♠)

Conventional poker hands are 5 cards.  Additional cards do not play.  Use only
the best five cards.

For instance, in a Hold'em board where I have K♠K♦ as my hole cards, the board
has TT55A, I have two pair; and I lose to your A♦2♣ (KKTTA loses to AATT5).

Aces are allowed to be the highest or lowest card in a straight.  Aces act as
high cards in other hands.

For more information, consult the little card that came in the pack, or the
first few minutes of any episode of *Celebrity Poker Showdown* on YouTube.
