Win the Button
==============

*Win the Button* is a variation of a poker tournament where the player who
wins the hand receives the button for the subsequent hand. Thus, the button does
not rotate as typical and players can end up paying (or not paying) blinds several
hands in a row. If there is a chopped pot won by two or more players, the winning
player in the worst position on that hand receives the button for the next hand.
This variation is typically not used in split-pot games.
