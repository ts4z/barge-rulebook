# Poker Games

Poker games are listed here alphabetically, including both well-known
(Hold'em) and less well known ([Bidrectional
Chowaha](bidirectional-chowaha.md)).  Of course, some of the
names are surprising ([Chowaha](chowaha.md) is not next to [Four-Card
Chowaha](four-card-chowaha.md)) but they are
still technically alphabetized.

There are a lot of games here.  Historically at BARGE,
[Chowaha](chowaha.md) is quite popular, and the [Pot-Limit](pot-limit.md)
[Binglaha](binglaha.md) game has been known to run very late on Saturday
night.

Mixed games based around [HORSE](glossary.md#HORSE) are mainstays, particularly with something
substituting out for [Razz](razz.md). One variant is HOSER, which sometimes means
Razz is gone and [Action Razz](action-razz.md) is in its place.

[Oklahoma](oklahoma.md) appears to be popular with dealers for a reason
that the "cash game" rule should make clear.

### Variations

The wide variety of already existing poker games lends itself naturally to
making up even more variations.

Some games here are decribed as variations that can be applied to multiple
other games.  These are described in an abridged fashion to save space and to
make the variation apply to more games.

A variation that applies to only one game will be described on the page for
that game.

It's somewhat arbitrary to differentiate between a game and a variation, and we
attempted consistency in this book.

For clarity, and to highlight popular combinations, we usually re-state the
rules of the game rather than try to describe the variations that make up the
game.

However, some variations are simple enough to just explain in isolation.  This
is either because they are applied to multiple games, they are rare, or both.
These are marked as variation in the title section.
