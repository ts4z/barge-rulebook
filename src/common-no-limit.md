No-Limit
--------

In no-limit poker, when a player chooses to bet or raise, the size of the raise can
be anywhere from the minimum bet to all-in (i.e. all of the chips the player has in
front of them, or what many of us call the “jam”). The minimum bet will be equal
to the size of the large blind. The minimum raise is the size of the last wager. A
player who wishes to bet or raise but does not have enough chips to make the
minimum wager may go all-in with their remaining chips. Stud variations without
blinds are rarely played in a no-limit format. The minimum bet would be the size
of the bring-in in such a format.

As an example, suppose you are playing no-limit holdem in a tournament at the
100/200 level. Unlike limit, this means that the small blind is 100 and the large
blind is 200. Often each player will also put in an ante; this is commonly done
in later levels of no-limit holdem tournaments. A recent innovation is the big
blind ante, where instead of all players anteing every hand, the players take turns
posting a consolidated ante for the whole table, usually when in the big blind.
Suppose the action folds to the player on the button, who says raise. The minimum
raise in this situation would be 200 (making it 400 to go), and the maximum raise
is all chips the button has. Suppose the button raises 300, making it 500 to go.
The small blind then may fold, call 300, or raise anywhere from 300 (making it
800 to go) to all their chips. Suppose the small blind raises 700, making it 1200 to
go. The big blind’s options would be to fold, call 1000 (i.e. 300+700), or raise a
minimum of 700. Suppose the big blind folds. The button may now either fold,
call 700, or raise a minimum of 700. In our case, the button calls, and a flop is
dealt.

Unlike limit poker, the half bet size rule does not apply to no-limit poker. A player
who has already acted and is not facing a fullsize wager may not subsequently
raise an all-in bet that is less than the minimum bet or less than the full size of
the last bet or raise.

There are an unlimited number of raises available to the players. Check and raise
is allowed.
