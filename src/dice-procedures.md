Dice Procedures
---------------

A few games involve the players rolling dice in order to influence the game.
In these games, the dice (or die) are rolled by the player on the button. Dice
must land flush on the table having traveled at least the distance to the far
side of the dealer’s box.

Dice must tumble.  They may not be slid.

The dealer is responsible for calling a valid or invalid roll.

Traditionally, there is a price to be paid for not rolling the dice properly.
Typically, this is a $1 tip for the first invalid roll, doubling for each
subsequent roll.  This encourages the dealers to have patience with poor
rollers.
