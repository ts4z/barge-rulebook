Poker Variants
==============

Poker variants are listed here alphabetically, including both well-known
(Hold'em) and less well known (Bidrectional Chowaha).  Of course, some of the
names are surprising (Chowaha is not next to Four-Card Chowaha) but they are
still alphabetized.

There are a lot of games here.  Historically at BARGE, [Chowaha](#chowaha) is quite
popular, and the Pot-Limit [Binglaha](#binglaha) game has been known to run very late on
Saturday night.

Mixed games based around HORSE are mainstays, particularly with something
substituting out for [Razz](#razz). One variant is HOSER, which sometimes means
Razz is gone and [Action Razz](#action-razz) is in its place.

Oklahoma appears to be popular with dealers for a reason that the "cash game"
rule should make clear.
