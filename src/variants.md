Poker Variants
==============

Poker variants are listed here alphabetically, including both well-known
(Hold'em) and less well known ([Bidrectional
Chowaha](./game-bidirectional-chowaha.md)).  Of course, some of the
names are surprising ([Chowaha](./game-chowaha.md) is not next to [Four-Card
Chowaha](./game-four-card-chowaha.md)) but they are
still technically alphabetized.

There are a lot of games here.  Historically at BARGE,
[Chowaha](./game-chowaha.md) is quite popular, and the [Pot-Limit](./common-pot-limit.md)
[Binglaha](./game-binglaha.md) game has been known to run very late on Saturday
night.

Mixed games based around HORSE are mainstays, particularly with something
substituting out for [Razz](./game-razz.md). One variant is HOSER, which sometimes means
Razz is gone and [Action Razz](./game-action-razz.md) is in its place.

[Oklahoma](./game-oklahoma.md) appears to be popular with dealers for a reason
that the "cash game" rule should make clear.
