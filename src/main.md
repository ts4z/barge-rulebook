Action Razz
-----------
### Forced Money
The game is played with antes. The high card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in. The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by the K♥, K♦,
K♣, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure
Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. Action starts with the lowest hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown
The best five-card California low hand wins the pot, but with the provision that a
player must have at least one face card (Jack, Queen, or King) among their seven
cards to qualify. 

A hand that qualifies is called a “Face” hand, while a hand that does not
qualify is called a “Butt” hand. It is not necessary to play a face card in the
best five-card California low hand, but any hand containing a face card defeats
any hand without a face card.

As an extreme example, the hand A♥ 2♥ 3♠ 4♣ 5♦ 6♠ 7♣, which would be the nuts
in razz as it is typically played, would lose to K♥ K♦ K♠ K♣ Q♦ Q♠ Q♣, which
would be the nut low in typical razz. The first player has a “Butt” Five, while
the second player has a “Face” Queens full of Kings.

If two or more players reach showdown and none of the players have a face card,
then the winner is determined based on the best five-card California low hand
(i.e. just like typical razz).

A more realistic example is shown in the following hand, with three players at
showdown.

* Player 1: 2♥ 2♦ 3♠ 3♣ 4♦ 5♠ 7♣
* Player 2: A♥ A♦ 2♠ 4♣ 4♥ 6♠ 8♣
* Player 3: 3♥ 5♦ 7♠ 8♦ 9♥ Q♠ K♣

Player 3 wins with their “Face” Nine, 98753. If there was a side pot between
Player 1 and Player 2, Player 1’s “Butt” Seven, 75432 would beat Player 2’s “Butt”
Eight, 8642A.

### Notes

Action Razz is a creation of Kevin Un.

It is believed that the origination of the the terms “Face” and “Butt” for
qualifying and non-qualifying hands in Action Razz is due to Cliff Matthews,
when he was coding the game and needed to evaluate the razz hands with the
addition of the face card qualifier.

### Evaluating the Showdown

this differs from standard razz) and the best (ace-to-four) badugi hand splits the
pot. A face card is not required to win the badugi hand. There is no qualifier for
either the action razz or badugi hand. If there is no four-card badugi hand, the
best three-card hand wins half the pot.

sixes.

Four Card Chowaha High/Low Eight-or-Better
------------------------------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three flops are dealt one above the other forming a 3 × 3 square of cards. This is
followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.

Two turn cards are dealt vertically to the right of the flop cards from the dealer’s
persepective. This is followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit.

One river card is placed to the right of the turn cards. This is followed by a
round of betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.  At the
showdown, the board will look like the following:

```
X X X
      Y
X X X   Z
      Y
X X X
```

The cards labelled X are the flop cards, the cards indicated as Y are the turn
cards, and Z is the river card.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or better
splits the pot. Each hand consists of two cards from the player’s hole cards plus
the cards from one flop, one turn, and the river. These may be played in any
combination EXCEPT that board cards used CANNOT consist of the top row of
the flop plus the bottom turn card or the bottom row of the flop plus the top turn
card. That is, the flop, turn, and river must all be contiguous cards. Each player
may create their best high hand and low hand using different hold cards and/or
different board cards. Also, as in Omaha, each player must use exactly two hole
cards plus three cards from the board to form each portion of their hand.

### Notes

Chowaha was created by Mike Chow.  See also [the two-card variant](#chowaha).

London Lowball
--------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with antes. The high card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in. The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by the K♥, K♦,
K♣, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting. For all rounds, the minimum bet will
be equal to the size of the bring-in and the minimum raise is the size of the last
bet or raise. The maximum wager is the size of the pot.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting. Action starts with the lowest hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting. This is followed by a showdown.

It is required of each player that they do not alter or obfuscate the order in which
they have received their up cards.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card Ace-to-Six low hand wins the pot. Straights and flushes count
against the player, unlike California Lowball (Ace-to-Five) but like Kansas City
Lowball (Deuce-to-Seven). Unlike Deuce-to-Seven, the Ace is the low card, not
the high card. Thus the nuts is a non-flush 6432A hand. See the 
[Appendix on Lowball Scales](#appendix-a-lowball-scales).

### Notes

The rules for London Lowball were written assuming the game is played
pot-limit, which is traditional for this game as described in Pot-Limit & No-Limit
Poker by Stewart Reuben and Bob Ciaffone and how it was played at BARGE
2018. It is not played with a joker/bug.

Mexican Poker
-------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with antes and a button which rotates clockwise after each
hand. 

### Dealing Procedure

The player with the high card showing clockwise of the dealer button goes
first. A Joker dealt face-up is considered to be an ace for the purposes of the high
hand.

A deck of 41 cards is used, where all of the eights, nines, and tens have been
removed and a single Joker has been added. A Joker that is dealt face up serves as
a bug and can be used either as an Ace or to complete a straight or flush. A Joker
that is dealt face down serves as a completely wild card and assumes any value to
make the player’s best possible five-card poker hand. A Joker that is dealt face
down and exposed by a player is still a completely wild card, rather than a bug.

Starting with the player to the left of the button, each player is dealt one card
face down then one card up. The player with the high card makes a bet, at either
the small or large betting limit, followed by a round of betting. All raises must be
at least equal to the size of the last bet.

After the betting round is complete, each remaining player has to decide whether
or not to expose their down card.

A third card is dealt to each player. The card is dealt face down if both of the
player’s cards have been exposed, otherwise it is dealt face up. This is followed
by a round of betting, starting with the player with the highest hand showing
clockwise of the dealer button.
After the betting round is complete, each remaining player has to decide whether
or not to expose their down card.

A fourth card is dealt to each player. The card is dealt face down if all of the
player’s cards have been exposed, otherwise it is dealt face up. This is followed
by a round of betting, starting with the player with the highest hand showing
clockwise of the dealer button.

After the betting round is complete, each remaining player has to decide whether
or not to expose their down card.

A fifth card is dealt to each player. The card is dealt face down if all of the player’s
cards have been exposed, otherwise it is dealt face up. This is followed by a round
of betting, starting with the player with the highest hand showing clockwise of
the dealer button.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high five-card poker hand wins the pot. Since the stripped deck of 41
cards is being used, a flush will outrank a full house. Because the eights, nines,
and tens have been removed, a hand such as 5-6-7-J-Q is a straight.

Mississippi Stud/Stud High-Low Eight-or-Better/Razz
---------------------------------------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting, starting with the player to the left of
the big blind (as is usual for games with blinds). For all rounds, the minimum bet
will be equal to the size of the big blind and the minimum raise is the size of the
last bet or raise. The maximum wager is the size of the pot.

Two up cards are dealt to each player in the way stud up cards are dealt, that is,
starting in seat 1. This is followed by a round of betting. The betting is initiated
by the best high poker hand showing for stud and stud high-low eight-or-better.
The betting is initiated by the best low poker hand for razz.

A fourth up card is dealt to all players. This is followed by a round of betting. The
best high poker hand on the board leads the betting for stud and stud high-low
eight-or-better. The betting is initiated by the best low poker hand for razz.

A fifth up card is dealt to all players. This is followed by a round of betting
starting with the best high poker hand on the board for stud and stud high-low
eight-or-better. The betting is initiated by the best low poker hand for razz.
If there are not enough cards in the stub to deal every remaining player a card, a
single community card is dealt instead.

It is required of each player that they not alter or obfuscate the order in which
they have received their up cards.

### Evaluating the Showdown

In Mississipi Stud, the best high five-card hand wins the pot.

In Mississippi Stud High-Low, the pot is split between
the best high five-card hand and the best California low hand with an 8 qualifier.
(If there is no low hand, the high hand scoops.)

In Mississippi Razz, the best five-card California low hand wins the pot
(without a qualifier).

### Notes
The rules for Mississippi Stud were written assuming the game is played
pot-limit, with blinds.

The game was designed by David Zanetti to be a version of stud more amenable to
a big-bet format than standard seven-card stud. See [this entry from the old
RGP
FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20150907103507/http://www.rgpfaq.com/mississippi-stud.html).


Murder
------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit. Two columns of three cards each (X) are placed in the center of
the table as the flop. There is a round of betting at the lower limit.

A third column of three community cards (Y) are placed face up. This is followed
by a round of betting at the big bet limit.

A fourth column of three community cards (Z) are placed face up. This is followed
by a round of betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.
The final board will look like this:

```
X X Y Z
X X Y Z
X X Y Z
```

All the X cards are placed on the board on the flop, the Y cards on the turn, and
the Z cards on the river.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high hand and the best California low hand with an 8-or-better qualifier
split the pot. As in Omaha, hands are made using exactly two cards from each
player’s hand and exactly three cards from the board to form each portion of their
hand. When forming a hand (high or low), each player may use only one card
from each row on the board! Separate hand and board cards may be used by each
player to create their high and low hands.

### Notes

Warning! Given the number of cards in a player’s hand, the number of possible
combinations of cards that may be used from the board, the fact that the game is
split pot, and the fact that each hand must be formed using only one card present
in each row of the board cards, evaluating hands can be especially tricky.

Oklahoma
--------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three flops are dealt one above the other forming a 3 × 3 square of cards. This is
followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.
Three turn cards (one for each flop) are placed on the board, lined up vertically to
the right of the flops (forming a 3 × 4 grid). This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.
A fifth column of three additional community cards are placed face up. At this
point, the board will look like the following:

```
X1 X1 X1 Y1 Z1
X2 X2 X2 Y2 Z2
X3 X3 X3 Y3 Z3
```

All the X cards are placed on the board on the flop, the Y cards on the turn, and
the Z cards on the river.

Next, the horizontal row of cards (board) with the lowest river card by rank is
removed from play. The deuce is the lowest rank and the Ace is the highest rank
for card removal. If two river cards share the same lowest rank, then both are
removed. If all three river cards share the same rank, no boards are removed. In
this way, “tournament” Oklahoma differs from “cash game” Oklahoma, where all
three boards are removed and the dealer wins the pot.

For example, if Z1, Z2, and Z3 are the 3♥, 8♠, and 3♣ respectively, then all of
the cards on both row 1 and row 3 are removed. Board removal is followed by a
round of betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown
The best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or better
splits the pot. Hands are made using exactly two cards from each player’s hand
and exactly three cards from one of the remaining boards. A player may use
different cards for their low and high hand, and they may use different boards for
their low and high hand.

cards from each player’s hand and exactly three cards from the board.

### Notes

This game is most commonly played as pot-limit (PLO), but is sometimes played
as a limit game.  Most limit games, however, are
[Omaha/8](#omaha-highlow-eight-or-better).

Omaha High/Low Eight-or-Better
------------------------------

Omaha High/Low Eight-or-Better is frequently abbreviated to Omaha/8 or O/8.

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown
The best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or better
splits the pot. Hands are made using exactly two cards from each player’s hand
and exactly three cards from the board. Note: If there are not three unpaired
cards eight or lower on the board, no low hand is possible. If no qualifying low
hand is made, the high hand scoops the pot.

### Notes

Both limit (O8) and pot-limit versions (PLO8) of this game are popular.

Omaha X or Better
-----------------

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

At this point two (standard) dice are rolled, in accordance with the [Dice
Procedures](#dice-procedures).  These determine "X", the qualifier for the low
hand:

* 12: Queen
* 11: Jack
* 10 down to 5: face value
* 4, 3, or 2: no low hand

One additional community card is place faced up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

Hands are made using exactly two cards from each player’s hand and exactly
three cards from the board.  The pot is split between the best conventional
high hand and the best low hand, with a qualifier of X (the die roll).

If no qualifying low hand is made, the high hand always scoops the pot.

If the board does not have three cards under X on the board, no low is possible
(thus a die roll of 2, 3, or 4 rules out a low hand).

### Notes

This game was created by Christian "Dr. Doofenschmirtz" Jones.

Paradise Road Pick’em
---------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.


### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt three cards. The player under the gun determines whether the
hand will be played as Hold’em, Omaha High/Low Eight-or-Better, Razz, Stud,
or Stud High/Low Eight-or-Better (i.e. the HORSE games). When heads-up or
three-handed, the player with the button will choose the game for that hand. If
the under the gun player is absent from the table or otherwise cannot or will not
choose a game, the default game to be played is Hold’em.

If Hold’em is selected, each player must discard one card. If Omaha/8 is selected,
each player is dealt an additional card. The hand then plays out as the selected
game, with action beginning with the player under the gun.

If Razz, Stud, or Stud High/Low is selected, each player will in turn (with action
beginning with the player under the gun) either fold, call, or raise. If they call or
raise they will expose (i.e. roll) a door card of their choice at that time.

For stud variations, on fourth street and beyond the cards will be dealt starting at
the dealer’s left and the betting action will start with the player with the high or
low hand, as appropriate for the variation being played. The small bet will be the
size of the big blind and the big bet will be double the size of the big blind. For
example, if the blinds are 50/100, then the small bet of 100 is used on 3rd and 4th
streets and the big bet of 200 is used on 5th, 6th, and 7th streets.

Please refer to rules of the individual game for further details on dealing procedure
and evaluating the showdown.

The game is played with antes. The low card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in. The 2♣ is the lowest possible card followed by the 2♦, 2♥,
2♠, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure
Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.  The initial
action goes to the player with the forced bring-in.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. Note: Unlike seven card stud for high only, even if
there is an open pair on fourth street, all bets on this street will always be at the
small bet limit. Action starts with the highest hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown
The best high five-card hand and the best California low hand with a qualifier of
eight-or-better split the pot.

is no qualifier for low.

### Notes

This game is also known as Stud High/Low Regular.

Super Stud/Stud High-Low Eight-or-Better/Razz
---------------------------------------------

(This section needs to be reworded; it is missing details.  I believe the
nominal dealer button gets to pick the variant after looking at their cards.)

### Forced Money

The game is played with antes. If the game is stud or stud high-low eight-or-better,
the low card on the board by rank first and then by suit brings it in. The 2♣ is
the lowest possible card followed by the 2♦, 2♥, 2♠, and so on.

If the game is razz, the high card on the board by rank first and then by suit
brings it in. The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by the K♥, K♦, K♣,
and so on.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt four cards face down
then one card up. At this point, the game proceeds as stud, stud high-low
eight-orbetter, or razz, except that at the end of the first betting round,
each remaining player will discard two of their four down cards. Refer to the
rules of that variation for further details.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or better
splits the pot. Hands are made using either exactly two cards from each player’s
hand and exactly three cards from the board or using all five cards in each player’s
hand, whichever produces the superior hand. A player may use all five cards in
one direction and use only two cards in the other. If no qualifying low hand is
made, the high hand scoops the pot.

Example: One player is dealt A♥ Q♥ J♥ T♥ 2♥. The board is 3♠ 5♥ 7♣ K♥ Q♦.

The player plays the A♥ 2♥ from their hand to make a 7532A low, and all five
cards from their hand to make a ace-queen high flush.

Note that this player does not have the nut low, as it is possible that another
player holds a five card hand that makes a better California low hand than
7532A.
