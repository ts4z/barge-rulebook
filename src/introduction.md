# Introduction

This book is split into three main sections: Procedures, Poker Games, and Variations.

[General Rules](general.md) apply to many games.  In most cases,
the host casino will have specific procedures.  For completeness, we have
described a few high-level ones, and a few specific to BARGE.

[Poker Games](poker-games.md) provide many different poker variants.  These are
intended to be mostly self-contained, and tend to restate the obvious a little
bit.  We hope this means you can read one page instead of having to hunt for
the general case.

[Variations](variations.md) provide modifications to a number of games.
Because poker lends itself to variations, it's easy to combine these in new
ways.  However, it is tedious to have to refer to several alleged variations in
order to play a common combination, like Badacey.  So for these common, complex
combinations, we prefer to have a specific page for those games.

Older versions of the rulebook didn't have a Variations section, so the
organization may change.

Lastly, we have an [Appendix](appendix.md) with some relatively hard-to-find
material worth highlighting.
