# Introduction

This rulebook codifies various poker games that may feature, or have been
featured, at BARGE.  It is a supplement for the host casino's rulebook and the
TDA rules, not a replacement for them.  We intend to capture the things that
are unique to BARGE, but we also try to be a general (if sometimes informal)
reference for poker games in general.

This book is split into three main sections: Procedures, Poker Games, and Variations.

[General Rules](general.md) apply to many games.  In most cases,
the host casino will have specific procedures.  For completeness, we have
described a few high-level ones, and a few specific to BARGE.

[Poker Games](poker-games.md) provide many different poker variants.  These are
intended to be mostly self-contained, and tend to restate the obvious a little
bit.  We hope this means you can read one page instead of having to hunt for
the general case.

The poker games section contains a number of variations, which 
provide just the changes, which apply to some number of games.

However, it is tedious to have to refer to several alleged variations in
order to play a common combination, like Badacey.  So for these common, complex
combinations, we prefer to have a specific page for those games.

Lastly, we have an [Appendix](appendix.md) with some relatively hard-to-find
material worth highlighting.
