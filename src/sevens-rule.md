Appendix B: The “Sevens Rule”
=============================

_From Michael Wiesenberg’s “Go For Low” column in Card Player Magazine_

Most California cardrooms have something called the sevens rule. After the draw,
you must bet a 7 or better whenever you are either first to bet, or those ahead of
you have passed. If you do not, you cannot win any action after the draw, and, in
some clubs, you forfeit the entire pot. Of course, if you have a 7 or better and
someone bets ahead of you, you can throw the hand away if you do not think it
will win.

Strictly speaking, you can pass a 7 or better after the draw, and then call with it.
If you do, though, all you can do is lose. Here’s why. If someone bets after you,
and hers is a worse hand (and you call), the rules let her remove her money from
the pot. If hers is the better hand, however, and you call, your money stays in
the pot. In those few clubs in which you lose the entire pot by passing a 7, if you
inadvertently make the mistake of passing, just quietly throw your cards away.
Don’t make a fuss. They won’t change the rules just for you.

There actually are an extremely few instances in which it is mathematically
sound to pass and then call with a 7 (because you lose less than if you bet). An
explanation of when you can profitably do so is way beyond the scope of the early
part of this series. I mention it only because renowned poker theoretician David
Sklansky has written about when to make the play. For all practical purposes,
however, if you just assume that it is never correct to pass and call with a 7 or
better, particularly in no-limit lowball, you won’t make many mistakes.
Players are likely to inadvertently pass 7s (or better) in two situations:

1. A new player gets flustered and forgets the rule. He passes without thinking.
   Sometimes he remembers the rule before the next player has acted, and tries
   to un-pass, with some such remark as, “I forget about that sevens rule. Can
   I make a bet now?” Sometimes he remembers after the next player has acted,
   often after the next player has already passed, and now when he tries to bet,
   an argument ensues. No matter how it happens, however, he gives away his
   hand, and chills the after-the-draw action.
2. A player draws several cards, usually three or more, and passes without
   looking at her cards, unconsciously concluding that she could not possibly
   make a 7 or better drawing that many cards. Of course, the time she passes
   blind is often the time she makes that miracle draw. What often happens is
   that she ends up losing money, because someone would have called a bet.

There are two obvious countermeasures for these situations.

The first is always be aware of the sevens rule. Remember that it is in force
in almost every California cardroom that has lowball. Be aware of what your
hand is when it is your turn to act, and don’t pass if you have a 7 or better.

The second is, when you take multiple cards, don’t pass blind; don’t assume
that you can’t possibly make a hand. Look at your cards and, again, if you
have a 7 or better, bet.

How the sevens rule comes into effect when you call an all-in bet that is less than a
full bet: You can inadvertently run afoul of the sevens rule in the following way. If
someone makes a bet in turn that is less than a full bet, and you just call (rather
than completing the bet) with a 7 or better, and someone calls or raises behind
you, that person gets his bet back (unless he has you beat, of course).

Example: The limit is $20. Four players call, so the pot now contains $80. (For
simplicity, lets assume that three of the players are the blinds.) After the draw,
John, directly to the left of the button, has only $15 left, which he bets. You, on
the big blind, who drew two cards, got lucky and made a wheel. You don’t want to
scare either of the two remaining players, so you just call, knowing that you can’t
win any more from John. Cindy, who had originally opened the pot and was pat,
says, “I complete the bet”, and puts in $20. Henry, on the button, who had drawn
one card, now raises, by putting in $40. A side pot is created. The bet skips John,
who is out of chips. You say, “I raise”, and someone at the table informs you that
since check-raising is not permitted in limit poker, all you can do is call.

Cindy, though, reraises, and Henry just calls the bet. You call the extra bet. The
hands are shown. John made an 8−4−3−2−A, and is out of contention. You
show your wheel 5−4−3−2−A, and start to reach for the pot. Cindy shows a
6−4−3−2−A and Henry shows 6−5−4−3−2. The house dealer pushes all
of Cindy’s and Henry’s post-draw betting back to them, and pushes the center pot
to you, consisting of that initial $80, plus the $30 that constitutes the $15 that
John bet and you called. You don’t win the extra $120 that Cindy and Henry put
in, because what you did is a violation of the sevens rule. Had you completed the
bet, by putting in an extra $5 with your $15, you would have won a lot more.

So here’s what to remember. If someone goes all in ahead of you and that bet is
less than a full bet, be sure to complete the bet if you have a 7 or better. That is,
put enough into the pot to turn your call into as much as the limit of the game.
Of course, there’s nothing to stop you from completing the bet even if you have
worse.

The same thing holds in no-limit lowball. If someone goes all in ahead of you and
that bet is less than the minimum bet for the game, be sure to complete the bet if
you have a 7 or better. So, for example, if the blinds were $5-$5-$10, the minimum
bet would be $20. If after the draw the player ahead of you goes all in for $15 and
you have a pat wheel and at least one player remains behind you, make sure to
put in at least $20. Since its a no-limit game, you can of course put in as much
more as you like.
