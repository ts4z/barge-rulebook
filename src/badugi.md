### Dealing Procedure
Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Each player in turn discards zero to four cards from their hand. Once all of the
discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. This is followed by a round of betting at the small
bet limit.

Then there is a second draw, followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit.
This is followed by a third draw, followed by a round of betting a the big bet limit.
This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best four-card hand using badugi rules wins the pot. A badugi hand consists
of the maximum number of cards that can be played such that there is no
duplication of rank or suit. Between hands of the same number of cards, the one
with the lowest hand (aces count as low) shall be the best hand. 432A of four
different suits is the best possible hand. KQJT of four different suits beats
any three-card hand.  A three-card hand of 742 beats 75A. See the [Appendix on
Lowball Scales](./lowball-scales.md) for more details.
