Omaha X or Better
-----------------

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

At this point two (standard) dice are rolled, in accordance with the [Dice
Procedures](./dice-procedures.md).  These determine "X", the qualifier
for the low hand:

* 12: Queen
* 11: Jack
* 10 down to 5: face value
* 4, 3, or 2: no low hand

One additional community card is place faced up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

Hands are made using exactly two cards from each playerâ€™s hand and exactly
three cards from the board.  The pot is split between the best conventional
high hand and the best low hand, with a qualifier of X (the die roll).

If no qualifying low hand is made, the high hand always scoops the pot.

If the board does not have three cards under X on the board, no low is possible
(thus a die roll of 2, 3, or 4 rules out a low hand).
