Bounty
------

A *bounty* in a tournament is a prize that is won by eliminating a player. 

In a split-pot game, the bounty is typically awarded to the winner of the high
hand/five-card hand portion.  In a chopped pot, the bounty winner will be the
player in worst position.

The winner of the tournament keeps their bounty.

At BARGE 2021, bounties will be used in the No Limit California Lowball
tournament as a “green chip” ($25) bounty per player.
