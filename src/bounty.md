# Bounty

A *bounty* in a tournament is a prize that is won by eliminating a player.

In a split-pot game, the bounty is typically awarded to the winner of the high
hand/five-card hand portion.  In a chopped pot, the bounty winner will be the
player in worst position.

The winner of the tournament keeps their bounty.

At BARGE 2021, the No Limit California Lowball
tournament featured a “green chip” ($25) bounty per player.
