Stud
----

Stud, also known as Seven-Card Stud, was a dominant game in many cities
throughout the '70s.

### Forced Money

The game is played with antes. The low card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in. The 2♣ is the lowest possible card followed by the 2♦, 2♥,
2♠, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. If a player shows an open pair a bet or raise may
optionally be a big bet. In this case a small bet can be met by a big bet raise. A
big bet may never be met with a small bet raise. Action starts with the highest
hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high five-card hand wins the pot.
