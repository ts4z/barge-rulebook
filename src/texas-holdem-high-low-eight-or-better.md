Texas Holdâ€™em High/Low Eight-or-Better
----------------------------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt two cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high five-card hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or
better splits the pot. If no qualifying low hand is made, the high hand scoops the
pot.

### Notes

Unlike Omaha, a player may use both, one, or none of the cards in their hand to
make either the high or the low.
