Super Stud
----------

(This section needs to be reworded; it is missing details.  I believe the
nominal dealer button gets to pick the variant after looking at their cards.)

This game combines Stud, Stud High-Low Eight-or-Better, and Razz.

### Forced Money

The game is played with antes. If the game is stud or stud high-low eight-or-better,
the low card on the board by rank first and then by suit brings it in. The 2♣ is
the lowest possible card followed by the 2♦, 2♥, 2♠, and so on.

If the game is razz, the high card on the board by rank first and then by suit
brings it in. The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by the K♥, K♦, K♣,
and so on.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt four cards face down
then one card up. At this point, the game proceeds as stud, stud high-low
eight-orbetter, or razz, except that at the end of the first betting round,
each remaining player will discard two of their four down cards. Refer to the
rules of that variation for further details.
