# Super Stud

This game is a variation of seven-card stud games.  This game modifies the
rules of either [stud](./stud.md), [Stud High/Low
Eight-or-Better](stud-high-low-eight-or-better.md), or [Razz](./razz.md).  Each
player starts with four down cards, and must discard two before fourth street.

## Forced Money

The game is played with antes. 

If the game is stud or stud high-low eight-or-better, the low card on the board
by rank first and then by suit brings it in. The 2♣ is the lowest possible card
followed by the 2♦, 2♥, 2♠, and so on.

If the game is razz, the high card on the board by rank first and then by suit
brings it in. The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by the K♥, K♦, K♣,
and so on.

## Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt four cards face down
then one card up. 

At this point, there is a betting round.  As in [stud](./stud.md), [Stud
High/Low Eight-or-Better](stud-high-low-eight-or-better.md), or
[Razz](./razz.md), there is a bring-in and a round of betting.

Next, each player must discard two cards before fourth street is dealt.

Once fourth street is dealt, the game proceeds as in the regular stud
variation.
