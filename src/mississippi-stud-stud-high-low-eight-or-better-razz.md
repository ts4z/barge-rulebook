Mississippi Stud/Stud High-Low Eight-or-Better/Razz
---------------------------------------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting, starting with the player to the left of
the big blind (as is usual for games with blinds). For all rounds, the minimum bet
will be equal to the size of the big blind and the minimum raise is the size of the
last bet or raise. The maximum wager is the size of the pot.

Two up cards are dealt to each player in the way stud up cards are dealt, that is,
starting in seat 1. This is followed by a round of betting. The betting is initiated
by the best high poker hand showing for stud and stud high-low eight-or-better.
The betting is initiated by the best low poker hand for razz.

A fourth up card is dealt to all players. This is followed by a round of betting. The
best high poker hand on the board leads the betting for stud and stud high-low
eight-or-better. The betting is initiated by the best low poker hand for razz.

A fifth up card is dealt to all players. This is followed by a round of betting
starting with the best high poker hand on the board for stud and stud high-low
eight-or-better. The betting is initiated by the best low poker hand for razz.
If there are not enough cards in the stub to deal every remaining player a card, a
single community card is dealt instead.

It is required of each player that they not alter or obfuscate the order in which
they have received their up cards.

### Evaluating the Showdown

In Mississipi Stud, the best high five-card hand wins the pot.

In Mississippi Stud High-Low, the pot is split between
the best high five-card hand and the best California low hand with an 8 qualifier.
(If there is no low hand, the high hand scoops.)

In Mississippi Razz, the best five-card California low hand wins the pot
(without a qualifier).

### Notes
The rules for Mississippi Stud were written assuming the game is played
pot-limit, with blinds.

The game was designed by David Zanetti to be a version of stud more amenable to
a big-bet format than standard seven-card stud. See [this entry from the old
