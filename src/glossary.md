### Run It Twice

When two players are all in and there are more board cards to come, deal out
multiple boards and split the pot, once for each board.  This helps reduce
variance in these situations.  The host poker room will have specific rules for
this scenario.

### Scoop

1. Win both ways in a split pot game.
2. In a [run-it-twice](#run-it-twice) situation, win both times.
