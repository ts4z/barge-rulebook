HORSE
:   A common mixed game of Hold'em, Omaha/8, Razz, Stud, and Stud/8 (with the
    emphasis on the "E" in eight.)

Run It Twice
:   When two players are all in and there are more board cards to come, deal out
    multiple boards and split the pot, once for each board.  This helps reduce
    variance in these situations.  The host poker room will have specific rules for
    this scenario.

Scoop
:   Win both ways in a split pot game.
:   In a&nbsp;[run-it-twice](#run-it-twice)&nbsp;situation, win both times.
