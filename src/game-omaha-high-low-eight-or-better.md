### Evaluating the Showdown
The best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or better
splits the pot. Hands are made using exactly two cards from each playerâ€™s hand
and exactly three cards from the board. Note: If there are not three unpaired
cards eight or lower on the board, no low hand is possible. If no qualifying low
hand is made, the high hand scoops the pot.
