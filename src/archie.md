## Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

## Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Each player in turn discards zero to five cards from their hand. Once all of the
discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. This is followed by a round of betting at the small
bet limit.

Then there is a second draw, followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit.

This is followed by a third draw, followed by a round of betting a the big bet limit.

This is followed by a showdown.

## Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card high hand and California low hand splits the pot. A player must
have a pair of sixes or better to qualify for the high hand and eight or better to
qualify for the low hand. In the case where no player qualifies in either direction,
the high hand, even though it is weaker than a pair of sixes, scoops the pot.

## Notes

Sometimes the qualifier for high hand is a pair of nines rather than a pair of
sixes.
