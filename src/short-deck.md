Short Deck
----------

*Short Deck*, also referred to as a “stripped deck”, is when certain
denominations of cards are removed, leaving a smaller deck. The most common
such variation is when a deck of 36 cards is used, where all of the deuces,
treys, fours, and fives have been removed, leaving a deck with sixes, sevens,
eights, nines, tens, Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Aces in the four suits. Refer to
the rule pages for [Short Deck Texas Hold’em](short-deck-texas-holdem.md) and
[Short Deck Omaha](short-deck-omaha.md), as there are some changes to the rank
of hands made for combinatorial reasons.

Another variation, used in [Mexican Poker](mexican-poker.md), is to remove the
eights, nines, and tens from the deck and to add a single joker, leaving a deck
of 41 cards. Refer to the rule page for [Mexican Poker](./mexican-poker.md) for
further details in the play of this variation.
