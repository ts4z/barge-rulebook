Short Deck
----------
**Short Deck**, also referred to as a “stripped deck”, is when certain
denominations of cards are removed, leaving a smaller deck. The most common
such variation is when a deck of 36 cards is used, where all of the deuces,
treys, fours, and fives have been removed, leaving a deck with sixes, sevens,
eights, nines, tens, Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Aces in the four suits. Refer to
the rule pages for Short Deck Texas Hold’em and Short Deck Omaha, as there are
some changes to the rank of hands made for combinatorial reasons.

Another variation, used in Mexican poker, is to remove the eights, nines, and tens
from the deck and to add a single joker, leaving a deck of 41 cards. Refer to the
rule page for Mexican Poker for further details in the play of this variation.
