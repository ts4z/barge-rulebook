# Crayfish

Crayfish provides a variant of [Omaha](omaha.md) and [Hold’em](holdem.md) (and
potentially any other game that uses a Hold'em board).

All five cards of the Hold'em board are dealt on the flop.  On the turn and river, roll a die.

On a roll of 1-5, flip the corresponding card over.  Cards are numbered from
left to right relative to the dealer.

On a roll of 6, no cards are turned over.

If both the flop and river happen to roll the same number, the card will be turned face down on the turn,
and turned face up on the river.

Face down cards can't be used at showdown.
