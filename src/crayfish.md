## Crayfish

Crayfish provides a variant of [Hold’em](texas-holdem.md) (and
potentially any other game that uses a five-carda board).

All five cards of the board are dealt on the flop.  On the turn and river, roll a die.

On a roll of 1-5, flip the corresponding card face down.  Cards are numbered
from left to right (flop 1-3, turn 4, river 5).

On a roll of 6, no cards are turned over.

If the number is rolled on the turn and river, the card remains turned face down.

Face down cards can't be used at showdown.
