Crazy Pineapple High/Low Eight-or-Better
----------------------------------------

### Forced Money

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt three cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit. Before the next board card is revealed, all players in the
hand must discard one of their cards. This is typically done by placing their
discard underneath chips that are placed in the pot on the flop.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high five-card hand and best five-card California low hand of at least
eight low or better splits the pot. Hands are made using either zero, one, or two
cards from each playerâ€™s hand and the remaining cards from the board.
Note: If there are not three unpaired cards eight or lower on the board, no low
hand is possible. If no qualifying low hand is made, the high hand scoops the pot.
