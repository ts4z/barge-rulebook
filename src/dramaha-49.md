# Dramaha 49

## Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

## Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a
round of betting at the small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

Then each player in turn discards zero to *three* cards from their hand. Once all
of the discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. Note that this differs from [Triple Draw Dramaha](triple-draw-dramaha.md),
where the draw takes place *before* the flop betting.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by the showdown.

## Evaluating the Showdown

The best Omaha high hand (using exactly two cards from the player’s hand and
exactly three cards from the board) and the best point value hand (using all five
cards from the player’s hand) splits the pot, where points are assigned: 
 * Ace = 1
 * 2 through 10 = numerical value of that card
 * and face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) = 0.
 
The nut point value hand would be TTTT9, for 10+10+10+10+9=49 points,
hence the name Dramaha 49. 

## Notes

Some online sources say that face cards are worth 1 point, but not according to BARGE.

Sometimes spelled Drawmaha 49.
