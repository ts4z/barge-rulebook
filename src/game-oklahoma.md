### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three flops are dealt one above the other forming a 3 × 3 square of cards. This is
followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.
Three turn cards (one for each flop) are placed on the board, lined up vertically to
the right of the flops (forming a 3 × 4 grid). This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.
A fifth column of three additional community cards are placed face up. At this
point, the board will look like the following:

```
X1 X1 X1 Y1 Z1
X2 X2 X2 Y2 Z2
X3 X3 X3 Y3 Z3
```

All the X cards are placed on the board on the flop, the Y cards on the turn, and
the Z cards on the river.

Next, the horizontal row of cards (board) with the lowest river card by rank is
removed from play. The deuce is the lowest rank and the Ace is the highest rank
for card removal. If two river cards share the same lowest rank, then both are
removed. If all three river cards share the same rank, no boards are removed. In
this way, “tournament” Oklahoma differs from “cash game” Oklahoma, where all
three boards are removed and the dealer wins the pot.

For example, if Z1, Z2, and Z3 are the 3♥, 8♠, and 3♣ respectively, then all of
the cards on both row 1 and row 3 are removed. Board removal is followed by a
round of betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown
The best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or better
splits the pot. Hands are made using exactly two cards from each player’s hand
and exactly three cards from one of the remaining boards. A player may use
different cards for their low and high hand, and they may use different boards for
their low and high hand.
