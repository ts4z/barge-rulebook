# Appendix D: Killer Cards Revisited (Abridged)

*Abridged from [Tim Showalter's original
version](https://psaux.com/poker/killer-cards.html) which includes more details
nobody wants.*

Super/System 2 contains a chart called Lyle Berman's Killer Cards Chart (page
461). This chart explores a flaw in simple outs: just because you hit your hand
doesn't mean your opponent won't make a better one.

Berman didn't show his work, so I recalculated it.  My numbers match his.  I
have included a chart for Hold 'Em as well as Omaha.  (Hopefully these charts
didn't get mangled from the translation from HTML, to Markdown, to LaTeX!)

These charts broadly covers most cases, but not all.  Runner-runner events (the
turn completes my flush against your set, but the river pairs the board filling
you up) are not adequately explored by this table.
