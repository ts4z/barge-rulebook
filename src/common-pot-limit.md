Pot-Limit
---------
In pot-limit poker, when a player chooses to bet or raise, the size of the raise can
be anywhere from the minimum bet to the size of the pot. The minimum bet
will be equal to the size of the large blind. The minimum raise is the size of the
last bet or raise. A player who wishes to bet or raise but does not have enough
chips to make the minimum wager may go all-in with their remaining chips. Stud
variations without blinds are sometimes played in a pot-limit format, with the
minimum bet being the size of the bring-in.

For an example, suppose you are playing in a pot-limit Omaha tournament at the
100/200 level. Unlike limit and like no-limit, this means that the small blind is 100
and the large blind is 200. Suppose the action folds to the player on the button,
who says raise. The minimum raise in this situation would be 200 (making it 400
to go), and the maximum raise would be the size of the pot. As the first player
to act pre-flop, the pot size will be 3.5 times the big blind (i.e. 7 times the small
blind), so the maximum raise is to make it 700 (a raise of 500). This assumes that
the first action is prior to the small blind, both blinds are posted, and that the
small blind is exactly half the big blind. Suppose the cut-off makes it 500, a raise
of 300. The button says pot. The pot-sized bet will be 3L + T, where L (the last
wager, by the button) is L = 500 and the trail T = 300 (the blinds), Here, that
will be equal to 3*500 + 300 =1800, so the button makes it 1800 to go, a raise of
1300.

For a second example, suppose you are playing a pot-limit London Lowball (i.e. Ace-to-Six razz) 
tournament where the ante is 100 and the bring-in is 150. With eight
players, the size of the pot is 8 ∗ 100 + 150 = 950. Player A brings it in for 150.
Player B says raise. The minimum raise Player B can make is 150 (the size of the
bring-in), to 300, and the maximum raise is 950 + 150 = 1100, to 1250 (call 150 +
raise of 1100). Suppose Player B raised 500, to 650, and Player C says pot. The
pot-sized bet will be 3L + T, where L (the last wager, by Player B) is L = 650,
the trail T (the bring-in by Player A and the antes) is T = 950, so the pot-sized
bet is to 3 ∗ 650 + 950 = 2900, a raise of 2250. Notice that if we used 3L + T for
Player B, we get 3 ∗ 150 + 800 = 1250, a raise of 1100, as we got before.
Unlike limit poker, the half bet size rule does not apply to pot-limit poker. A player
who has already acted and is not facing a fullsize wager may not subsequently
raise an all-in bet that is less than the minimum bet or less than the full size of
the last bet or raise.

There are an unlimited number of raises available to the players. Check and raise
is allowed.
