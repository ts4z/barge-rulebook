California Lowball
==================

## Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

## Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Each player in turn discards zero to five cards from their hand. Once all of the
discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards.

This is followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit. This is followed
by a showdown.

California Lowball is usually played with a joker/bug. The joker is used as the
lowest non-pairing card.

## Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card California lowball hand wins the pot.  See the [Appendix on
Lowball Scales](./lowball-scales.md) for more details.

NOTE: California Lowball is most commonly played as a limit game, with the
Sevens Rule (see [Appendix B](./sevens-rule.md)) in effect and with no
check-and-raise allowed. It is also sometimes played as a no-limit game, with
no Sevens Rule and with check-and-raise allowed.

## Notes

The no-limit format was featured in a bounty tournament at BARGE 2021.
