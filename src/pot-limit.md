Pot-Limit
---------

In *pot-limit* poker, when a player chooses to bet or raise, the size of the raise can
be anywhere from the minimum bet to the size of the pot. The minimum bet
will be equal to the size of the large blind. The minimum raise is the size of the
last bet or raise. A player who wishes to bet or raise but does not have enough
chips to make the minimum wager may go *all-in* with their remaining chips.

Unlike [limit](./limit.md) and [no-limit](./common-no-limit.md), a
player is entitled to the current count of the pot.

Stud variations without blinds are sometimes played in a pot-limit format, with
the minimum bet being the size of the bring-in.

The maximum bet in a round without action is simply the size of the pot.

The maximum raise is the size of the pot *after the call* of the initial
action.

### Examples

For an example, suppose you are playing in a pot-limit Omaha tournament at the
100/200 level.  Like [no-limit](./no-limit.md), this means that the
small blind is 100 and the large blind is 200. In this example, the action
folds to the player on the button, who says raise.

The minimum raise in this situation would be 200, making it 400 to-go.

The maximum raise is the size of the pot.  In this case, that is 700 to-go, or
a raise of 500 on top of the 200 blind.  That is, the button says "raise",
allowing them to call 200; there is now that 200 + 100 small blind + 100 big
blind in the pot; the button can make it 700 to-go.

In this example, suppose the big blind calls.  There is 1500 in the pot (100
small blind + 700 big blind + 700 button).  On the flop, the big blind bets out
the maximum, 1500.  The button says "raise pot".  It is now 6000 to-go (1500
pot+1500 bet+1500 call = 4500 raise).

A common shortcut is that a pot raise of a pot bet is 4✕ the pot bet, which can
be seen in the example above.

More generally, a pot raise of *any* bet is 3✕ the bet, plus any other money
behind.  This requires a little bit more explanation.

For example, suppose we have a new hand at the 100/200 level.  The button
limps, the small blind completes and the big blind checks.  The pot is 600.

On the flop, the small blind bets out 200.  The big blind calls.  The button
says "raise pot".  He laboriously puts out 200, then counts 400 (pot), plus the
three 200 bets this round, and makes it 1200 to-go.

One of the players at the table will usually "helpfully" pipe up at this point
and point out that the shortcut is to take 3✕ the bet, plus any money behind.
In this case, that's 3✕200 + 200 (caller) + 400 (pot) and that's still 12
to-go.

For a stud example, suppose you are playing a pot-limit [London
Lowball](./london-lowball.md) tournament where the ante is 100 and the
bring-in is 150. With eight players, the pot starts at 8 ✕ 100 = 800. Player A
brings it in for 150.  Player B says raise. The minimum raise Player B can make
is 150 (the size of the bring-in), to 300 to-go; and the maximum raise is
800+150+150 = 1100, to 1250 to-go (call 150 + raise of 1100).

Suppose Player B raises 500, to 650 to-go.

Player C then says "pot".  A pot-sized raise will be 3✕650, + 950 = 2900 to-go,
or a raise of 2250.

Unlike limit poker, the half bet size rule does not apply to pot-limit poker. A
player who has already acted and is not facing a full-size wager may not
subsequently raise an all-in bet that is less than the minimum bet or less than
the full size of the last bet or raise.

There are an unlimited number of raises available to the players. Check and raise
is allowed.
