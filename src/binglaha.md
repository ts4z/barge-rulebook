# Binglaha

## Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure
Each player is dealt four cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

At this point a single (standard) die is rolled, in accordance with the [Dice
Procedures](./dice-procedures.md).

If the die result is a 1, 2, or 3, the game is played high/low split
eight-or-better. If the die result is 4, 5, or 6, the game is played high only.

One additional community card is place faced up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

## Evaluating the Showdown

Either the best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or
better split the pot or the best high hand scoops the pot, depending on the results
of the die roll. Hands are made using exactly two cards from each player’s hand
and exactly three cards from the board.

Note: if there are not three unpaired cards eight or lower on the board, no low
hand is possible regardless of the roll of the die. If no qualifying low hand is made,
the high hand always scoops the pot.
