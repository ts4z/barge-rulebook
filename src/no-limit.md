No-Limit
--------

In *no-limit* poker, when a player chooses to bet or raise, the size of the raise can
be anywhere from the minimum bet to *all-in* (i.e. all of the chips the player has in
front of them, or what many of us call the “jam”). The minimum bet will be equal
to the size of the large blind.  The minimum raise is the size of the last wager. A
player who wishes to bet or raise but does not have enough chips to make the
minimum wager may go *all-in* with their remaining chips. 

Many flop games have an ante structure.  Any ante does not impact the minimum
or maximum bet.

Stud variations without blinds are rarely played in a no-limit format. The
minimum bet would be the size of the bring-in in such a format.

As an example, suppose you are playing [No-Limit Hold'em](./holdem.md) in
a tournament at the 100/200 level. Unlike [limit](./limit.md), this
means that the small blind is 100 and the large blind is 200.  The
action folds to the player on the button, who says raise. 

The minimum raise in this situation would be 200 more (making it 400 to go),
and the maximum raise is all chips the button has.  Suppose the button raises
300, making it 500 to go.  The small blind then may fold, call 300, or raise
anywhere from 300 (making it 800 to go) to all their chips. Suppose the small
blind raises 700, making it 1200 to go. The big blind’s options would be to
fold, call 1000 (i.e. 300+700), or raise a minimum of 700. Suppose the big
blind folds. The button may now either fold, call 700, or raise a minimum
of 700. In our case, the button calls, and a flop is dealt.

Unlike limit poker, the half bet size rule does not apply to no-limit poker. A player
who has already acted and is not facing a fullsize wager may not subsequently
raise an all-in bet that is less than the minimum bet or less than the full size of
the last bet or raise.

There are an unlimited number of raises available to the players. Check and raise
is allowed.
