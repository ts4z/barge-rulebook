Reno Straight
=============

We actually have no idea what this game is called, but Greg Raymer told us he
played in Reno, so here we are.

This game is allegedly a variant of [Big O](big-o.md).

## Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

## Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Two boards of three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

Two additional community cards are placed face up, one for each board.. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

Two additional community cards are placed face up, one for each board. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

This is followed by a showdown.

## Evaluating the Showdown

The best Omaha hand, and the best *straight* split the pot, using either board.

This game is played "best-best".  Unlike most double-board games, the best high
hand (using either board) and the best low hand (using either board) split the
pot.

If at showdown, no one can make a straight, the high hand scoops.
