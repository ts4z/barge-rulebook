Bounty
------
A **bounty** in a tournament is a prize that is won by eliminating a player. In a
split-pot game, the bounty is typically awarded to the winner of the high hand/fivecard hand portion. In a chopped pot, the bounty winner will be the player in
worst position. At BARGE 2021, bounties will be used in the No Limit California
Lowball tournament as a “green chip” ($25) bounty per player. The winner of the
tournament keeps their bounty.
