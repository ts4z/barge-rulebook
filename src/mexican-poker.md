# Mexican Poker

### Forced Money

The game is played with antes and a button which rotates clockwise after each
hand. 

### Dealing Procedure

The player with the high card showing clockwise of the dealer button goes
first. A Joker dealt face-up is considered to be an ace for the purposes of the high
hand.

A deck of 41 cards is used, where all of the eights, nines, and tens have been
removed and a single Joker has been added. A Joker that is dealt face up serves as
a bug and can be used either as an Ace or to complete a straight or flush. A Joker
that is dealt face down serves as a completely wild card and assumes any value to
make the player’s best possible five-card poker hand. A Joker that is dealt face
down and exposed by a player is still a completely wild card, rather than a bug.

Starting with the player to the left of the button, each player is dealt one card
face down then one card up. The player with the high card makes a bet, at either
the small or large betting limit, followed by a round of betting. All raises must be
at least equal to the size of the last bet.

After the betting round is complete, each remaining player has to decide whether
or not to expose their down card.

A third card is dealt to each player. The card is dealt face down if both of the
player’s cards have been exposed, otherwise it is dealt face up. This is followed
by a round of betting, starting with the player with the highest hand showing
clockwise of the dealer button.
After the betting round is complete, each remaining player has to decide whether
or not to expose their down card.

A fourth card is dealt to each player. The card is dealt face down if all of the
player’s cards have been exposed, otherwise it is dealt face up. This is followed
by a round of betting, starting with the player with the highest hand showing
clockwise of the dealer button.

After the betting round is complete, each remaining player has to decide whether
or not to expose their down card.

A fifth card is dealt to each player. The card is dealt face down if all of the player’s
cards have been exposed, otherwise it is dealt face up. This is followed by a round
of betting, starting with the player with the highest hand showing clockwise of
the dealer button.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high five-card poker hand wins the pot. Since the stripped deck of 41
cards is being used, a flush will outrank a full house. Because the eights, nines,
and tens have been removed, a hand such as 5-6-7-J-Q is a straight.
