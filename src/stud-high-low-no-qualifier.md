Stud High/Low No Qualifier
--------------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with antes. The high card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in (as in razz). The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by
the K♥, K♦, K♣, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. Note: Unlike seven card stud for high only, even if
there is an open pair on fourth street, all bets on this street will always be at the
small bet limit. Action starts with the lowest hand showing (as in razz).

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

It is required of each player that they do not alter or obfuscate the order in which
they have received their up cards.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high five-card hand and the best California low hand split the pot. There
is no qualifier for low.

### Notes

This game is also known as Stud High/Low Regular.
