Big O (Five Card Omaha High/Low Eight-or-Better)
------------------------------------------------

### Forced Money
The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure
Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown
The best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or better
splits the pot. Hands are made using exactly two cards from each player’s hand
and exactly three cards from the board. Note: If there are not three unpaired
cards eight or lower on the board, no low hand is possible. If no qualifying low
hand is made, the high hand scoops the pot.

NOTE: Big O is usually played as a pot-limit game, but was played as a limit
game for the Big OE mix at BARGE 2021.
