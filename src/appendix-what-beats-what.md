Appendix C: What Beats What
===========================

No list of poker rules is complete without yet another regurgitation of
standard poker hand order.

Standard order is as follows:

* Straight Flush, five cards in sequence in the same suit (2♣3♣4♣5♣6♣)
* Four of a Kind, a.k.a. Quads, four cards of the same rank + a kicker (e.g.,
  8♠8♥8♣8♦J♠)
* Full House, a.k.a. Full Boat, House, three cards of the same rank, then two
  cards of a different rank (7♣7♠7♦2♥2♦)
* Flush, five cards in the same suit (A♥K♥9♥7♥6♥)
* Straight, five cards in sequence of more than one suit (5♣6♦7♦8♠9♦)
* Three of a Kind, a.k.a. Trips (6♣6♦6♥A♥K♠)
* Two Pair, such as two aces and two eights with some other card as a kicker
* One Pair, (e.g., 5♥5♠7♣8♣9♣)
* High Card, a.k.a. Nothing (2♠3♠4♦5♣7♥ or A♥K♥Q♥J♥2♠)

Conventional poker hands are 5 cards.  Additional cards do not play.  Use only
the best five cards.

For instance, in a Hold'em board where I have K♠K♦ as my hole cards, the board
has TT55A, I have two pair; and I lose to your A♦2♣ (KKTTA loses to AATT5).

Aces are allowed to be the highest or lowest card in a straight.  Aces act as
high cards in other hands.

first few minutes of any episode of *Celebrity Poker Showdown* on YouTube.
