Triple Draw Dramaha
-------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. Each player in turn discards zero to
five cards from their hand. Once all of the discards have been announced, the
dealer will deal each player an appropriate number of replacement cards. This is
followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit. Note that this differs from
Dramaha, where the draw takes place AFTER the flop betting.

One additional community card is placed face up. Each player in turn discards
zero to five cards from their hand. Once all of the discards have been announced,
the dealer will deal each player an appropriate number of replacement cards. This
is followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. Each player in turn discards zero
to five cards from their hand. Once all of the discards have been announced, the
dealer will deal each player an appropriate number of replacement cards. This is
followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best Omaha high hand (using exactly two cards from the player’s hand and
exactly three cards from the board) and the best five card draw hand (using all
five cards from the player’s hand) splits the pot.
