Shootout
--------

A *shootout* is a tournament where instead of having the number of tables gradually
reduced by breaking tables and moving players to replace eliminated players, each
table players down to a single winner, and those winners advance to play each
other. In a large enough tournament, there could be several levels. As an example,
a six-handed shootout tournament could start with 216 (which is 6³) players at
36 tables, with the 36 table winners advancing to a second round of 6 tables, and
those winner advancing to a final table of six. Typically some tables will have one
few player if the number of entrants isn’t a perfect square or cube. For example,
suppose 75 players enter a nine-handed shootout tournament. Since 81 players (9²)
would accomodate exactly 9 nine-handed tables, with table winners advancing to
a final table, in this case six of the nine tables would start with one fewer player.

Sometimes at BARGE shootouts have been played such that the final two players
from each table advance to the next round, rather than just a single player.
