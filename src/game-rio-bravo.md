Rio Bravo
---------

Rio Bravo is played just as [Hold'em](./game-holdem.md), except after the river betting,
each live player is dealt a third face-down hole card and then there's a final
(fifth) round of betting.

### Forced Money

The game is played with antes. The high card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in. The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by the K♥, K♦,
K♣, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. Action starts with the lowest hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

It is required of each player that they do not alter or obfuscate the order in which
they have received their up cards.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card California low hand and the best (ace-to-four) badugi hand
splits the pot. Note, there is no qualifier for either the razz or badugi hand. If
there is no four-card badugi hand, the best three-card hand wins half the pot.
