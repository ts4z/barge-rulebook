### Evaluating the Showdown

Hand order is the standard hand order with one extra rule.  A player who holds
3-of-a-kind in 2s up through 10s, and two other cards that add to the value of
the 3-of-a-kind, has a four-of-a-kind.  That is, 88862 is quad eights.

The best high five-card hand wins the pot.
