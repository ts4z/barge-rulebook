Preface
=======

This rulebook is an continuing update of Christopher J. Mecklin's excellent rulebook from
July 2021.  It had fallen a bit out of date, since it was last updated for
the 2021 BARGE tournaments; and BARGE being BARGE, and poker players being
poker players, some newer games have been made up.

This version was put together in 2024 from the PDF of the 2021 edition.  Many
formatting errors were introduced.  Some have even been fixed.

This rulebook codifies various poker games that may feature, or have been
featured, at BARGE.  It is a supplement for the host casino's rulebook and the
TDA rules, not a replacement for them.  This rulebook does duplicate parts of a
host casino's rulebook, but it also covers the things that are unique to BARGE.

### Web version and PDF Version

This rulebook is provided in both a web version and a PDF version.

The web version is continually updated at
[https://www.barge.org/rulebook/](https://www.barge.org/rulebook/).  It looks
great on a phone or a computer, and we can provide hyperlinks to rules.
Printed versions of the web site don't work well, though, and are hard to read
as hard copy.

The PDF version is available at
[https://www.barge.org/rulebook.pdf](https://www.barge.org/rulebook.pdf).
This prints to a proper book and should be printed double-sided.
It has a table of contents and page numbers.  It
includes hyperlinks when viewed electronically, but it is not as easy to
navigate as the web version. It is hard to use on a phone or tablet.  (This version may also be
slightly out of date compared to the web version, as updating it requires an
extra trivial step, easily forgotten.)

### Improving this Rulebook

[https://github.com/ts4z/barge-rulebook](https://github.com/ts4z/barge-rulebook).
You are encouraged to send pull requests, or suggestions over email, or over
beers.  *Substantive text changes are preferred over vague suggestions.*

Having a little more historical context on each game would be welcome.

Because the rulebook is generated in multiple versions and the translation
between the two is a little rickety, there are some technical limits as to what
we can provide.  I apologize in advance if I am unable to accommodate some
suggestions.

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to Rich Bremer, Doug Grismore, Patrick Milligan, and Cliff Matthews for
encouragement, and technical and editorial input.

### Preface from the 2021 Edition

(This section has been slightly abridged from the 2021 edition.)

This document contains the rules of many forms of poker, some of which will be
played in BARGE 2021 tournaments, others in tournaments in past years, and yet
others only in BARGE cash games or home games.

I obtained these rules from a copy of the official rule book for the XXV
25-Game Mix poker tournament played at BARGE XXV in 2015. That rule book was
originally written by Patrick Milligan and Rich Bremer and is reproduced here
with their permission. Also, rules for some of the stranger games came from an
archived version of the BARGE website, called the [BARGE Poker Game Rule
Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20120721203440/http://www.barge.org/rules/).
I have also referred to [Bob Ciaffone’s Robert’s Rules of
Poker](https://www.betsperts.com/poker/robs-poker-rules/).  [This link has been
updated, as RRP has moved with Bob Ciaffone's passing.]

Note that the rule book, unless otherwise noted, is written under the
assumption that the games are being played in a limit format, with a small
betting limit and a large betting limit. Please make appropriate adjustments
when playing that game in the pot-limit or no-limit format.

This document also includes Appendices explaining the [“Sevens Rule”
(originally written by Michael Weisenberg)](./sevens-rule.md) and various
[Lowball Scales](./lowball-scales.md) (written by me [Chris Mecklin]).
