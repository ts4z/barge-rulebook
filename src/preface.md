# Preface

We hope that this is a useful reference for BARGE folks,and for anyone else.
In particular, Tim started updating this rulebook because he can never remember
the rules to [Archie](archie.md) and wanted to make it easier to look them up.

This rulebook decends from Christopher J. Mecklin's excellent rulebook, last
updated in July, 2021.  By 2024, it had fallen a bit out of date: BARGE being
BARGE, and poker players being poker players, some newer games have been made
up.

This version was created starting from extracting the text from the PDF of the
2021 edition.  Many formatting errors were introduced in this process.  Some
have been fixed.

### Web version and PDF Version

This rulebook is provided in both a web version and a PDF version.

[https://www.barge.org/rulebook/](https://www.barge.org/rulebook/) is the web
home for this rulebook, and it is continually updated there.  It looks great on
a phone or a computer, and we can provide hyperlinks to rules from the Internet
at large.  It doesn't print very well.

[https://www.barge.org/rulebook.pdf](https://www.barge.org/rulebook.pdf) is a PDF version.
This prints to a proper book and should be printed double-sided.
It has a table of contents and page numbers.  It
includes hyperlinks if viewed electronically, but it is not as easy to
navigate as the web version. It is hard to use on a phone or tablet.  (This version may also be
slightly out of date compared to the web version, as updating it requires an
extra trivial step, easily forgotten.)

### Improving this Rulebook

The easiest thing to do is to contact [Tim Showalter](mailto:tim.showalter@gmail.com).

If you are technically inclined, the source code for the rulebook is 
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/ts4z/barge-rulebook)[^1].
A pull request is the clearest way to suggest a change, but you can also make
suggestions over email, or over beers.  *Specific text is appreciated.*

Having a little more historical context on each game would be welcome.

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to Rich Bremer, Doug Grismore, Patrick Milligan, and Cliff Matthews for
encouragement, and technical. and editorial input.

### Preface from the 2021 Edition

(This section has been slightly abridged from the 2021 edition.)

This document contains the rules of many forms of poker, some of which will be
played in BARGE 2021 tournaments, others in tournaments in past years, and yet
others only in BARGE cash games or home games.

I obtained these rules from a copy of the official rule book for the XXV
25-Game Mix poker tournament played at BARGE XXV in 2015. That rule book was
originally written by Patrick Milligan and Rich Bremer and is reproduced here
with their permission. Also, rules for some of the stranger games came from an
archived version of the BARGE website, called the [BARGE Poker Game Rule
Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20120721203440/http://www.barge.org/rules/).
I have also referred to [Bob Ciaffone’s Robert’s Rules of
Poker](https://www.betsperts.com/poker/robs-poker-rules/).  [This link has been
updated, as RRP has moved with Bob Ciaffone's passing.]

Note that the rule book, unless otherwise noted, is written under the
assumption that the games are being played in a limit format, with a small
betting limit and a large betting limit. Please make appropriate adjustments
when playing that game in the pot-limit or no-limit format.

This document also includes Appendices explaining the [“Sevens Rule”
(originally written by Michael Weisenberg)](./sevens-rule.md) and various
[Lowball Scales](./lowball-scales.md) (written by me [Chris Mecklin]).
