Ties & Odd Chips
----------------

When the situation arises where a pot needs to be split, such as in a split-pot game
or when two or more players tie for the winning hand, it is often the case that
there will be an odd chip or chips that will need to be assigned. The conventions
for splitting pots and dealing with odd chips are largely taken from 
[the TDA rules](https://www.pokertda.com/view-poker-tda-rules/). The pertinent sections are
General Concepts 20 and 21.

1. An odd chip is broken down into the smallest denomination in play.
2. No player may receive more than one off chip.
3. When two or more hands tie, an odd chip or chips are awarded as follows: 
   a. In games with a button, the first hand clockwise from the button (i.e. “worst
      position”) gets the odd chip; 
   b. In stud games, the odd chip will be given to
      the hand with the highest card by suit, where the ordering of suits is spades,
      hearts, diamonds, clubs; 
   c. In High-Low split games, the high hand receives
      the odd chip in a split between the high and low hands.
      
Some split-pot games that are not High-Low in the traditional sense are not
explicitly covered in the TDA rules. Here is how odd chips will be assigned.

* In split games that involve a five-card hand and a four-card hand, the
  fivecard hand is treated as the high hand. Examples of such games include
  Badacey, Badeucy, Razzdugi, and Action Razzdugi. For instance, an odd chip in
  Badacey would be awarded to the player with the best A-5 lowball hand, not
  the best badugi hand.

* In split pot games that involve a draw hand, where the player uses all five
  cards in their hand, and an Omaha hand, where the player uses two cards
  in their hand and three cards from the board, the draw hand is treated
  as the high hand. Examples of such games include Dramaha, Triple-Draw
  Dramaha, and Dramaha 49. For instance, an odd chip in Dramaha 49 would
  be awarded to the player with the best draw point value hand, not the best
  Omaha high hand.

* In Sohe (Simultaneous Omaha and Hold’em), where the players split a six-card
  hand into a four-card part used for Omaha and a two-card part used for
  Hold’em, the Omaha hand is treated as the high hand.

For any unusual situations that are not explicitly covered, the decision of the
tournament floor person would be final. The tournament staff will likely use
TDA Recommended Procedure 14 (RP-14), which states that “randomness may be
applied to special situations”.
