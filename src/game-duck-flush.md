Duck Flush
----------
### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Each player in turn discards zero to five cards from their hand. Once all of the
discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. This is followed by a round of betting at the small
bet limit.

Then there is a second draw, followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit.
This is followed by a third draw, followed by a round of betting a the big bet limit.
This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card high hand wins the pot, with the restriction that the qualifying
hand is a flush or better. If there are no qualifying high hands, then the best
five-card Kansas City low hand wins the pot. Notice that this is NOT a split pot
game.

Example: Player A makes A♥ Q♥ J♥ T♥ 2♥ and Player B makes K♣ J♣ 8♣
5♣ 3♣. Both players qualify for a high hand with their flushes and Player A wins
the pot with a better high hand.

Example: Player A makes 8♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠ 2♦, Player B makes 8♣ 6♦ 5♠ 4♥ 3♣,
Player C makes 7♥ 6♣ 5♥ 4♠ 3♦. Player A wins with the best Kansas City low
hand. Notice Player C’s straight does not qualify as a high hand.
