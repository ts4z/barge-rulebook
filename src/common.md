Common Rules, Betting Formats, and Variations
=============================================

Limit
-----

In limit poker, also called fixed-limit poker, the size of the raise a player makes is
predetermined by the structure of the game or tournament. The structure will
specify the size of the small bet, the large bet, the small and big blinds for games
that use blinds, and the ante and bring-in for games that use them. It is typical in
modern play for flop and draw variations to use blinds and for stud variations to
use antes and a bring-in. Antes are almost never used in flop or draw variations
played in either the limit or pot-limit format, but are commonly implemented in
conjunction with the blinds in the no-limit format.

As an example, suppose you are playing limit holdem in a tournament at the
100/200 level. This means that the small blind is 50 (typically half the small bet),
the large blind is 100, the small bet is also 100, and the large bet is 200. As this is
a flop game, the small bet limit is used pre-flop and after the flop, and the large
bet limit is used on the turn and river. In a game with only two rounds of action
rather than four, such as California Lowball, the pre-draw action is at the small
bet limit and the post-draw action at the large bet limit.

For a second example, suppose you are playing razz in a tournament at the 200/400
level with a 50 ante and a 75 bring-in. Each player will put in 50 before the first
three cards are dealt and the player with the highest door card is forced to make a
75 bring-in, with an option to instead complete to 200, the full size of the small bet.
The small bet of 200 is used for action on third and fourth streets (two rounds),
while the large bet of 400 is used on fifth, sixth, and seventh street (three rounds
of action). Most stud variations operate on this basis, with the bring-in being
either the player with the highest or lowest door card, depending on the game.

An all-in wager of less than half the bet does not reopen the betting for a player
that has already acted and is in the pot for all previous bets. A player facing less
than half a bet may fold, call, or complete the bet. For example, suppose a player
has made an all-in wager of 100 when the limit is 400. A subsequent player who
has not yet acted may fold, call 100, or complete to 400.
An all-in wager of a half bet or more is treated as as a full bet, and a player may
fold, call, or make a full raise. For example, suppose a player has made an all-in
wager of 300 when the limit is 400. A subsequent player wishing to raise would
make it 300+400=700.

The number of raises that can be made per streeet varies between different poker
rooms. Often a bet and 3 raises is allowed (i.e. it is possible to 4-bet but not to
5-bet); sometimes a bet and 4 raises is allowed. Often the cap on the number of
raises is removed when two players are heads-up in a cash game, but typically not
for a tournament. Check and raise is usually allowed, except in limit California
Lowball.

No-Limit
--------

In no-limit poker, when a player chooses to bet or raise, the size of the raise can
be anywhere from the minimum bet to all-in (i.e. all of the chips the player has in
front of them, or what many of us call the “jam”). The minimum bet will be equal
to the size of the large blind. The minimum raise is the size of the last wager. A
player who wishes to bet or raise but does not have enough chips to make the
minimum wager may go all-in with their remaining chips. Stud variations without
blinds are rarely played in a no-limit format. The minimum bet would be the size
of the bring-in in such a format.

As an example, suppose you are playing no-limit holdem in a tournament at the
100/200 level. Unlike limit, this means that the small blind is 100 and the large
blind is 200. Often each player will also put in an ante; this is commonly done
in later levels of no-limit holdem tournaments. A recent innovation is the big
blind ante, where instead of all players anteing every hand, the players take turns
posting a consolidated ante for the whole table, usually when in the big blind.
Suppose the action folds to the player on the button, who says raise. The minimum
raise in this situation would be 200 (making it 400 to go), and the maximum raise
is all chips the button has. Suppose the button raises 300, making it 500 to go.
The small blind then may fold, call 300, or raise anywhere from 300 (making it
800 to go) to all their chips. Suppose the small blind raises 700, making it 1200 to
go. The big blind’s options would be to fold, call 1000 (i.e. 300+700), or raise a
minimum of 700. Suppose the big blind folds. The button may now either fold,
call 700, or raise a minimum of 700. In our case, the button calls, and a flop is
dealt.

Unlike limit poker, the half bet size rule does not apply to no-limit poker. A player
who has already acted and is not facing a fullsize wager may not subsequently
raise an all-in bet that is less than the minimum bet or less than the full size of
the last bet or raise.

There are an unlimited number of raises available to the players. Check and raise
is allowed.

Pot-Limit
---------
In pot-limit poker, when a player chooses to bet or raise, the size of the raise can
be anywhere from the minimum bet to the size of the pot. The minimum bet
will be equal to the size of the large blind. The minimum raise is the size of the
last bet or raise. A player who wishes to bet or raise but does not have enough
chips to make the minimum wager may go all-in with their remaining chips. Stud
variations without blinds are sometimes played in a pot-limit format, with the
minimum bet being the size of the bring-in.

For an example, suppose you are playing in a pot-limit Omaha tournament at the
100/200 level. Unlike limit and like no-limit, this means that the small blind is 100
and the large blind is 200. Suppose the action folds to the player on the button,
who says raise. The minimum raise in this situation would be 200 (making it 400
to go), and the maximum raise would be the size of the pot. As the first player
to act pre-flop, the pot size will be 3.5 times the big blind (i.e. 7 times the small
blind), so the maximum raise is to make it 700 (a raise of 500). This assumes that
the first action is prior to the small blind, both blinds are posted, and that the
small blind is exactly half the big blind. Suppose the cut-off makes it 500, a raise
of 300. The button says pot. The pot-sized bet will be 3L + T, where L (the last
wager, by the button) is L = 500 and the trail T = 300 (the blinds), Here, that
will be equal to 3*500 + 300 =1800, so the button makes it 1800 to go, a raise of
1300.

For a second example, suppose you are playing a pot-limit London Lowball (i.e. Ace-to-Six razz) 
tournament where the ante is 100 and the bring-in is 150. With eight
players, the size of the pot is 8 ∗ 100 + 150 = 950. Player A brings it in for 150.
Player B says raise. The minimum raise Player B can make is 150 (the size of the
bring-in), to 300, and the maximum raise is 950 + 150 = 1100, to 1250 (call 150 +
raise of 1100). Suppose Player B raised 500, to 650, and Player C says pot. The
pot-sized bet will be 3L + T, where L (the last wager, by Player B) is L = 650,
the trail T (the bring-in by Player A and the antes) is T = 950, so the pot-sized
bet is to 3 ∗ 650 + 950 = 2900, a raise of 2250. Notice that if we used 3L + T for
Player B, we get 3 ∗ 150 + 800 = 1250, a raise of 1100, as we got before.
Unlike limit poker, the half bet size rule does not apply to pot-limit poker. A player
who has already acted and is not facing a fullsize wager may not subsequently
raise an all-in bet that is less than the minimum bet or less than the full size of
the last bet or raise.

There are an unlimited number of raises available to the players. Check and raise
is allowed.

Ties & Odd Chips
----------------

When the situation arises where a pot needs to be split, such as in a split-pot game
or when two or more players tie for the winning hand, it is often the case that
there will be an odd chip or chips that will need to be assigned. The conventions
for splitting pots and dealing with odd chips are largely taken from 
[the TDA rules](https://www.pokertda.com/view-poker-tda-rules/). The pertinent sections are
General Concepts 20 and 21.

1. An odd chip is broken down into the smallest denomination in play.
2. No player may receive more than one off chip.
3. When two or more hands tie, an odd chip or chips are awarded as follows: 
   a. In games with a button, the first hand clockwise from the button (i.e. “worst
      position”) gets the odd chip; 
   b. In stud games, the odd chip will be given to
      the hand with the highest card by suit, where the ordering of suits is spades,
      hearts, diamonds, clubs; 
   c. In High-Low split games, the high hand receives
      the odd chip in a split between the high and low hands.
      
Some split-pot games that are not High-Low in the traditional sense are not
explicitly covered in the TDA rules. Here is how odd chips will be assigned.

* In split games that involve a five-card hand and a four-card hand, the
  fivecard hand is treated as the high hand. Examples of such games include
  Badacey, Badeucy, Razzdugi, and Action Razzdugi. For instance, an odd chip in
  Badacey would be awarded to the player with the best A-5 lowball hand, not
  the best badugi hand.

* In split pot games that involve a draw hand, where the player uses all five
  cards in their hand, and an Omaha hand, where the player uses two cards
  in their hand and three cards from the board, the draw hand is treated
  as the high hand. Examples of such games include Dramaha, Triple-Draw
  Dramaha, and Dramaha 49. For instance, an odd chip in Dramaha 49 would
  be awarded to the player with the best draw point value hand, not the best
  Omaha high hand.

* In Sohe (Simultaneous Omaha and Hold’em), where the players split a six-card
  hand into a four-card part used for Omaha and a two-card part used for
  Hold’em, the Omaha hand is treated as the high hand.

For any unusual situations that are not explicitly covered, the decision of the
tournament floor person would be final. The tournament staff will likely use
TDA Recommended Procedure 14 (RP-14), which states that “randomness may be
applied to special situations”.

Big Blind Ante
--------------

Traditionally in no-limit Texas Hold’em tournaments, the blind structure used
was that two players posted blinds (the small blind and big blind) each hand.
Additionally, most tournaments featured an ante that would be posted by each
player before every hand, typically starting a few levels into the tournament. This
is done to further drive the action by increasing the amount of chips and thus the
incentive to enter the pot.

One of the disadvantages of having every player make an individual ante is time,
in terms of having the dealer gather up the antes, make change, remind forgetful
players to ante, and to deal with disagreements about unposted antes.

In the 2010s, a new idea known as the **big blind ante** was introduced in
tournament poker and quickly became the standard, where the player in the big
blind would post an ante for the entire table. One should think of the big
blind ante as a shared ante that all players take turn in paying rather than an
extra “penalty” for being in the big blind. The reason why the big blind ante
is not assigned to another position, such as the button, is that every hand
will have a player in the big blind but sometimes there will be a dead button.

Some controversies about the big blind ante include: (a) how large should it
be; (b) should the size of the big blind ante be reduced in short-handed
situations; and (c) how should the situation be handled where the player in the
big blind does not have sufficient chips to post both the ante and the big
blind. One should always consult the structure sheet and/or the tournament
director to verify how any particular tournament is handling the big
blind. Here, we describe how the big blind ante was handled at BARGE 2020,
keeping in mind that this might change in the future.

The size of the big blind ante was equal to the size of the small blind for a
six-handed tournament, and was equal to the size of the big blind for a full ring
(nine or ten-handed) tournament. The size of the big blind ante was NOT reduced
in the full ring tournament when tables became short-handed. A player with
insufficient chips to post both the big blind ante and the big blind would post the
ante first. For example, suppose a player has T18000 remaining with a big blind
of T10000 in a full ring tournament. This player would first post T10000 as the
ante and his last T8000 as an incomplete big blind. If the player had only T8000
left, they would post all of it into the ante and nothing into the big blind, and in
this situation the best case scenario for that player would be to win the hand and
get the T8000 back.

Bomb Pot
--------
The **bomb pot** is a variation of a no-limit Texas Hold’em tournament used at
BARGE starting in a 2021 tournament. In this variation, all players post an
ante pre-flop, and there is no pre-flop betting. Instead, the three-card flop
is dealt and action commences with the player to the left of the button. The
minimum bet size is the size of the ante. Otherwise, play is as normal for
no-limit Texas Hold’em. A button is still used and rotated around the table to
determine the player that will be first to act on each betting round.

Bounty
------
A **bounty** in a tournament is a prize that is won by eliminating a player. In a
split-pot game, the bounty is typically awarded to the winner of the high hand/fivecard hand portion. In a chopped pot, the bounty winner will be the player in
worst position. At BARGE 2021, bounties will be used in the No Limit California
Lowball tournament as a “green chip” ($25) bounty per player. The winner of the
tournament keeps their bounty.

Jam-or-Fold
-----------

**Jam-or-Fold** is a variation of a poker tournament where the player has only two
options for their initial action. They can either go all-in (“jam”) or fold.

Lammers
-------

**Lammers** are re-buy chips that players receive at the beginning of a tournament,
and at BARGE is most usually used in the Pot-Limit Omaha event. Players
may turn in any or all of their lammers before the start of the hand to receive
tournament chips equal to the assigned value of the lammers. Players may not
redeem lammers during the play of a hand. When a player busts but has remaining
lammers, they must use at least one lammer before the next hand.

Here are some examples of hypothetical lammer usage, based on the structure of
the 2020 BARGE PLO event. Players received T10000 in chips and two lammers
worth T5000 chips each. One possibility is to immediately redeem both lammers
before the first hand is dealt, thus starting with a T20000 stack. However, when
this player busts they are out of the tournament. Another possibility is that when a
player busts, they can redeem one of the two lammers to have T5000. Yet
another possibility is that a player, reduced to a T2000 stack, can 
redeem one lammer to increase their stack size to T7000.

Players are required to redeem all remaining lammers after a certain level,
which was Level 12 at BARGE 2020. This is done to prevent players from holding
onto lammers until deep in the tournament, at which point the value of the
lammers compared to the size of the blinds is so small that such a player would
be best served by folding every hand and trying to “farm” up the payout
schedule.

Shootout
--------
A shootout is a tournament where instead of having the number of tables gradually
reduced by breaking tables and moving players to replace eliminated players, each
table players down to a single winner, and those winners advance to play each
other. In a large enough tournament, there could be several levels. As an example,
a six-handed shootout tournament could start with 216 (which is 6³) players at
36 tables, with the 36 table winners advancing to a second round of 6 tables, and
those winner advancing to a final table of six. Typically some tables will have one
few player if the number of entrants isn’t a perfect square or cube. For example,
suppose 75 players enter a nine-handed shootout tournament. Since 81 players (9²)
would accomodate exactly 9 nine-handed tables, with table winners advancing to
a final table, in this case six of the nine tables would start with one fewer player.

Sometimes at BARGE shootouts have been played such that the final two players
from each table advance to the next round, rather than just a single player.

Short Deck
----------
**Short Deck**, also referred to as a “stripped deck”, is when certain
denominations of cards are removed, leaving a smaller deck. The most common
such variation is when a deck of 36 cards is used, where all of the deuces,
treys, fours, and fives have been removed, leaving a deck with sixes, sevens,
eights, nines, tens, Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Aces in the four suits. Refer to
the rule pages for Short Deck Texas Hold’em and Short Deck Omaha, as there are
some changes to the rank of hands made for combinatorial reasons.

Another variation, used in Mexican poker, is to remove the eights, nines, and tens
from the deck and to add a single joker, leaving a deck of 41 cards. Refer to the
rule page for Mexican Poker for further details in the play of this variation.

Win The Button
---------------
**Win The Button** is a variation of a poker tournament where the player who
wins the hand receives the button for the subsequent hand. Thus, the button does
not rotate as typical and players can end up paying (or not paying) blinds several
hands in a row. If there is a chopped pot won by two or more players, the winning
player in the worst position on that hand receives the button for the next hand.
This variation is typically not used in split-pot games.

Dice Procedures
---------------

A few games involve the players rolling dice in order to influence the game.
In these games, the dice (or die) are rolled by the player on the button. Dice
must land flush on the table having traveled at least the distance to the far
side of the dealer’s box.

Dice must tumble.  They may not be slid.

The dealer is responsible for calling a valid or invalid roll.

Traditionally, there is a price to be paid for not rolling the dice properly.
Experienced BARGE players will explain current tipping procedure.

Stud Procedures
---------------

In all stud games, it is required of each player that they do not alter or
obfuscate the order in which they have received their up cards.

Lowball
-------

Lowball has several variants, discussed in the appendix on [Lowball
Scales](#appendix-a-lowball-scales).
