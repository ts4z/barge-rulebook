### Forced Money

The game is played with antes. The high card on the board by rank first and
then by suit brings it in. The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by the
K♥, K♦, K♣, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down
then one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit,
starting with the player with the bring-in.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. Action starts with the lowest hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round
of betting at the big bet limit.

This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card California low hand and the best (ace-to-four) badugi hand
splits the pot. Note, there is no qualifier for either the razz or badugi hand. If
there is no four-card badugi hand, the best three-card hand wins half the pot.
