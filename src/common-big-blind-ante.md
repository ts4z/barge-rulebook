Big Blind Ante
--------------

Traditionally in no-limit Texas Hold’em tournaments, the blind structure used
was that two players posted blinds (the small blind and big blind) each hand.
Additionally, most tournaments featured an ante that would be posted by each
player before every hand, typically starting a few levels into the tournament. This
is done to further drive the action by increasing the amount of chips and thus the
incentive to enter the pot.

One of the disadvantages of having every player make an individual ante is time,
in terms of having the dealer gather up the antes, make change, remind forgetful
players to ante, and to deal with disagreements about unposted antes.

In the 2010s, a new idea known as the **big blind ante** was introduced in
tournament poker and quickly became the standard, where the player in the big
blind would post an ante for the entire table. One should think of the big
blind ante as a shared ante that all players take turn in paying rather than an
extra “penalty” for being in the big blind. The reason why the big blind ante
is not assigned to another position, such as the button, is that every hand
will have a player in the big blind but sometimes there will be a dead button.

Some controversies about the big blind ante include: (a) how large should it
be; (b) should the size of the big blind ante be reduced in short-handed
situations; and (c) how should the situation be handled where the player in the
big blind does not have sufficient chips to post both the ante and the big
blind. One should always consult the structure sheet and/or the tournament
director to verify how any particular tournament is handling the big
blind. Here, we describe how the big blind ante was handled at BARGE 2020,
keeping in mind that this might change in the future.

The size of the big blind ante was equal to the size of the small blind for a
six-handed tournament, and was equal to the size of the big blind for a full ring
(nine or ten-handed) tournament. The size of the big blind ante was NOT reduced
in the full ring tournament when tables became short-handed. A player with
insufficient chips to post both the big blind ante and the big blind would post the
ante first. For example, suppose a player has T18000 remaining with a big blind
of T10000 in a full ring tournament. This player would first post T10000 as the
ante and his last T8000 as an incomplete big blind. If the player had only T8000
left, they would post all of it into the ante and nothing into the big blind, and in
this situation the best case scenario for that player would be to win the hand and
get the T8000 back.
