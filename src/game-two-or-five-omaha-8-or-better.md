------------------------------------------

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high hand and best California low hand of at least eight low or better
splits the pot. Hands are made using either exactly two cards from each player’s
hand and exactly three cards from the board or using all five cards in each player’s
hand, whichever produces the superior hand. A player may use all five cards in
one direction and use only two cards in the other. If no qualifying low hand is
made, the high hand scoops the pot.

Example: One player is dealt A♥ Q♥ J♥ T♥ 2♥. The board is 3♠ 5♥ 7♣ K♥ Q♦.

The player plays the A♥ 2♥ from their hand to make a 7532A low, and all five
cards from their hand to make a ace-queen high flush.

Note that this player does not have the nut low, as it is possible that another
player holds a five card hand that makes a better California low hand than
7532A.
