Lammers
-------

*Lammers* are re-buy chips that players receive at the beginning of a
tournament, and at BARGE is most usually used in the
[Pot-Limit](./pot-limit.md) [Omaha](./game-omaha.md) event. Players may
turn in any or all of their lammers before the start of the hand to receive
tournament chips equal to the assigned value of the lammers. Players may not
redeem lammers during the play of a hand. When a player busts but has remaining
lammers, they must use at least one lammer before the next hand.

For an example of lammer usage, consider the 2020 BARGE PLO event.
In this tournament, players received T10000 in chips and two lammers worth
T5000 chips each.  A player could immediately redeem both lammers before the
first hand is dealt, thus starting with a T20000 stack; however, when this
player busts they are out of the tournament.

Another possibility is that when a player busts, they can redeem one of the two
lammers to have T5000.

Yet another possibility is that a player, reduced to a T2000 stack, can redeem
one lammer to increase their stack size to T7000.

Players are required to redeem all remaining lammers after a certain level,
which was Level 12 at BARGE 2020. This is done to prevent players from holding
onto lammers until deep in the tournament, at which point the value of the
lammers compared to the size of the blinds is so small that such a player would
be best served by folding every hand and trying to “farm” up the payout
schedule.
