Sohe (Simultaneous Omaha/Hold’em)
---------------------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.


### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt six cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Each player still in the hand after the pre-flop betting separates their six cards
into a two-card hand and a four-card hand, which will be used for Texas Hold’em
and Omaha High, respectively.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high hands, using the two-card Texas Hold’em hands and four-card Omaha
High hands, respectively, split the pot. The Texas Hold’em hands are made using
either zero, one, or both cards from each player’s hand. The Omaha hands are
made using exactly two cards from each player’s hand and exactly three cards
from the board.
