## Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt two cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

## Evaluating the Showdown
