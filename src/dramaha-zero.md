# Dramaha Zero

## Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

## Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a
round of betting at the small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

Then each player in turn discards zero to *three* cards from their hand. Once all
of the discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. Note that this differs from [Triple Draw Dramaha](triple-draw-dramaha.md),
where the draw takes place *before* the flop betting.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by the showdown.

## Evaluating the Showdown

The best Omaha high hand and the best point value hand split the pot.

The Omaha high hand uses exactly two cards from the player’s hole cards and
exactly three cards from the board.

The point value hand is played **for low** and uses all five of the player's hole cards.

Points are assigned as follows:
 * Ace = 1
 * 2 through 10 = numerical value of that card
 * and face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) = 0.
 
The nut point value hand would be five face cards (thus leading to the name
Dramaha Zero).  The worst hand would be TTTT9, the nut in [Dramaha 49](dramaha-49.md).
