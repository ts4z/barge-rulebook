Short Deck Texas Hold’em
--------------------------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds. 

### Dealing Procedure

A deck of 36 cards is used, where all of the deuces, treys, fours, and fives
have been removed, leaving a deck with sixes, sevens, eights, nines, tens,
Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Aces in the four suits.

Each player is dealt two cards face down, followed by a round of betting.
Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting.
One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
no-limit betting. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high five-card hand wins the pot. In this game, a flush outranks a
full house. Note that the lowest possible straight in this game is 9876A (the
“short deck wheel”) with the AKQJT (broadway) as the highest straight.  Note:
This game is also called Six-Plus Texas Holdem and was played with no-limit
betting at BARGE 2019. The game is sometimes played where three-of-a-kind beats
a straight. See
