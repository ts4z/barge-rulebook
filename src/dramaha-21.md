Dramaha 21
----------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a
round of betting at the small bet limit.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of betting
at the small bet limit.

Then each player in turn discards zero to *three* cards from their hand. Once all
of the discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. Note that this differs from [Triple Draw Dramaha](triple-draw-dramaha.md),
where the draw takes place *before* the flop betting.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

One additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by the showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The hand is split between the best Omaha high hand (using exactly two cards
from the player’s hand and exactly three cards from the board) and the best
point value hand.

Points are assigned using cards from the player's hole cards as follows:

 * Ace = 1
 * 2 through 10 = numerical value of that card
 * and face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) = 0.
 
Players may have 21 points, but no more.  Cards that would "bust" the player are ignored.

Ties are broken by having the most cards.  That is:

 * AKQTT = 5-card 21 (T+T+A=21, KQ zero)
 * AQT64 = 5-card 21 (T+6+4+A=21, Q zero)
 * KTT86 = 3-card 20 (T+T=20, K zero, 8 & 6 count toward neither the 21 nor the hand count)
 * 98765 = 3-card 21 (9+7+5=21, 8 & 6 don't count)

### Notes

Some online sources say that face cards are worth 1 point, but not according to BARGE.
