# Madison

## Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

## Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Each player in turn discards zero to five cards from their hand. Once all of the
discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. This is followed by a round of betting at the small
bet limit.

Then there is a second draw, followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit.

This is followed by a third draw, followed by a round of betting a the big bet limit.

This is followed by a showdown.

## Evaluating the Showdown

The lowest hand wins, ignoring pairs, straights, and flushes.  The best possible
hand is 2AAAA, and the worst possible hand is KKKKQ.

That is, the hand order is similar to [California
Lowball](california-lowball.md), except not only are straights and flushes
ignored, but pairs are ignored as well.
