Stud High/Low Eight-or-Better
-----------------------------

Seven Card Stud High/Low Eight-or-Better is frequently abbreviated to Stud/8.

### Forced Money

The game is played with antes. The low card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in. The 2♣ is the lowest possible card followed by the 2♦, 2♥,
2♠, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.  The initial
action goes to the player with the forced bring-in.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. Note: Unlike seven card stud for high only, even if
there is an open pair on fourth street, all bets on this street will always be at the
small bet limit. Action starts with the highest hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high five-card hand and the best California low hand with a qualifier of
eight-or-better split the pot.
