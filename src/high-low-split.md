# High/Low Split variations

## High/Low Split variations

First, there was high-only poker.  Soon after, there was lowball, invented by
any number of players who had one of those nights where they just couldn't
catch an ace.  Not long after that, someone must have decided to try both at
once.  Five-card high/low probably came first, although it is somewhat rare
now.

A number of games in this book are "split" variants, presumably deriving from
high/low draw poker.

We have specific sections for [Omaha High/Low](./omaha-high-low-eight-or-better.md),
[Stud/8](stud-high-low-eight-or-better.md), [Razzdugi](razzdugi.md),
[Badeucy](badeucy.md), [dramadugi.md](dramadugi.md) and [Stud High/Low No
Qualifier](./stud-high-low-no-qualifier.md), which all have their own rules
spelled out specifically.

In general (and to avoid having *every* pair of games combined specifically),
any two games can be combined into high/low, provided that:

* One game is "high" and one game is "low".  It is important to designate the
  high hand because since the high hand gets the odd chip (see [ties & odd
  chips](ties-odd-chips.md)).
* Extra cards in play do not affect the hand beyond the usual five cards
  (or four cards for a [Badugi](badugi.md) hand).

Extra rules may apply, such as these:

* In [Action Razz](action-razz.md), a 6th card can be used for a qualifier.
* In [Baducey](badeucy.md), aces play high for the [Badugi](badugi.md) hand and
  the 2-7 hand, even though they would generally be "good" cards in Badugi.
