Action Razz
-----------

### Forced Money
The game is played with antes. The high card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in. The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by the K♥, K♦,
K♣, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure
Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. Action starts with the lowest hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown
The best five-card California low hand wins the pot, but with the provision that a
player must have at least one face card (Jack, Queen, or King) among their seven
cards to qualify. 

A hand that qualifies is called a “Face” hand, while a hand that does not
qualify is called a “Butt” hand. It is not necessary to play a face card in the
best five-card California low hand, but any hand containing a face card defeats
any hand without a face card.

As an extreme example, the hand A♥ 2♥ 3♠ 4♣ 5♦ 6♠ 7♣, which would be the nuts
in razz as it is typically played, would lose to K♥ K♦ K♠ K♣ Q♦ Q♠ Q♣, which
would be the nut low in typical razz. The first player has a “Butt” Five, while
the second player has a “Face” Queens full of Kings.

If two or more players reach showdown and none of the players have a face card,
then the winner is determined based on the best five-card California low hand
(i.e. just like typical razz).

A more realistic example is shown in the following hand, with three players at
showdown.

* Player 1: 2♥ 2♦ 3♠ 3♣ 4♦ 5♠ 7♣
* Player 2: A♥ A♦ 2♠ 4♣ 4♥ 6♠ 8♣
* Player 3: 3♥ 5♦ 7♠ 8♦ 9♥ Q♠ K♣

Player 3 wins with their “Face” Nine, 98753. If there was a side pot between
Player 1 and Player 2, Player 1’s “Butt” Seven, 75432 would beat Player 2’s “Butt”
Eight, 8642A.

### Notes

Action Razz is a creation of Kevin Un.

It is believed that the origination of the the terms “Face” and “Butt” for
qualifying and non-qualifying hands in Action Razz is due to Cliff Matthews,
when he was coding the game and needed to evaluate the razz hands with the
addition of the face card qualifier.
