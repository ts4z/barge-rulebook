Badeucy
-------

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a
round of betting at the small bet limit.

Each player in turn discards zero to five cards from their hand. Once all of the
discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. This is followed by a round of betting at the small
bet limit.

Then there is a second draw, followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit.
This is followed by a third draw, followed by a round of betting at the big bet
limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best four-card hand using modified badugi rules wins half of the pot. The
other half of the pot goes to the best Deuce-to-Seven lowball hand.

In badeucy, an Ace is a high card. A badugi hand consists of the maximum number
of cards that can be played such that there is no duplication of rank or suit.
Between hands of the same number of cards, the one with the lowest hand shall
be the best hand. 5432 of four different suits is the best possible hand. AKQJ of
four different suits beats any three-card hand. A three-card hand of 743 beats 752.
