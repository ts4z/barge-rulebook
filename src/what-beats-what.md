Appendix C: What Beats What
===========================

No poker rulebook is complete without yet another recitation of poker hand
order.  (Compare [Lowball Scales](./lowball-scales.md) for some other hand
orders.)

Standard order is as follows:

* Straight Flush: five cards in sequence in the same suit (2♣3♣4♣5♣6♣);
  the highest one is called a Royal Flush (A♥K♥Q♥J♥T♥)
* Four of a Kind, a.k.a. Quads: four cards of the same rank + a kicker (e.g.,
  8♠8♥8♣8♦J♠)
* Full House, a.k.a. Full Boat, House: three cards of the same rank, then two
  cards of a different rank (7♣7♠7♦2♥2♦)
* Flush: five cards in the same suit (A♥K♥9♥7♥6♥)
* Straight: five cards in sequence of more than one suit (5♣6♦7♦8♠9♦)
* Three of a Kind, a.k.a. Trips: three cards of the same rank (6♣6♦6♥A♥K♠)
* Two Pair: two cards of one rank and two cards of another rank
  ([A♠A♣8♠8♣J♦](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6412452/))
* One Pair: two cards of the same rank (e.g., 5♥5♠7♣8♣9♣)
* High Card a.k.a. Nothing: (2♠3♠4♦5♣7♥ or A♥K♥Q♥J♥2♠)

Conventional poker hands are 5 cards.  Additional cards do not play.  Use only
the best five card combination in games that have larger hands.

For instance, in a Hold'em board where I have K♠K♦ as my hole cards, the board
has T♣T♦5♠5♥A♠, I have two pair; and I lose to your A♦2♣ (K♠K♦T♣T♦A♠ loses to
A♠A♦T♣T♦5♠).

Aces are allowed to be the highest or lowest card in a straight.  Aces act as
high cards in other hands.

first few minutes of any episode of *Celebrity Poker Showdown* on YouTube.
