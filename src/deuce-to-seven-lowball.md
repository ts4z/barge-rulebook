Deuce-To-Seven Lowball
======================

## Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

## Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Each player in turn discards zero to five cards from their hand. Once all of the
discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. This is followed by a round of betting at the big
bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

## Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card Kansas City lowball hand wins the pot.

## Notes

Also known as Kansas City Lowball, this game is most commonly played
as a no-limit game. It is not played with a joker/bug.
