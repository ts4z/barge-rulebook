Bomb Pot
========

The *bomb pot* is a variation of a [no-limit](./no-limit.md)
[Hold’em](./texas-holdem.md) tournament used at BARGE starting in a 2021
tournament. In this variation, all players post an ante pre-flop, and there is
no pre-flop betting. Instead, the three-card flop is dealt and action commences
with the player to the left of the button. The minimum bet size is the size of
the ante.  Otherwise, play is as normal for no-limit Texas Hold’em. A button is
still used and rotated around the table to determine the player that will be
first to act on each betting round.

Bomb pots are common in cash games, usually on a dealer change.
