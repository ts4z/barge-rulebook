Bomb Pot
--------
The **bomb pot** is a variation of a no-limit Texas Hold’em tournament used at
BARGE starting in a 2021 tournament. In this variation, all players post an
ante pre-flop, and there is no pre-flop betting. Instead, the three-card flop
is dealt and action commences with the player to the left of the button. The
minimum bet size is the size of the ante. Otherwise, play is as normal for
no-limit Texas Hold’em. A button is still used and rotated around the table to
determine the player that will be first to act on each betting round.
