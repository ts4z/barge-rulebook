## Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

## Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting at the
small bet limit.

Each player in turn discards zero to five cards from their hand. Once all of the
discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each player an appropriate
number of replacement cards. This is followed by a round of betting at the small
bet limit.

Then there is a second draw, followed by a round of betting at the big bet limit.

This is followed by a third draw, followed by a round of betting a the big bet limit.

This is followed by a showdown.

## Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card high hand and California low hand splits the pot. A player
must have a pair or better to qualify for the high hand and no pair to qualify for
the low hand. Notice that unlike Archie, every hand that makes it to showdown
will qualify in at least one direction, with straights and flushes qualifying in both
directions.
