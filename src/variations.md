# Variations

[Poker games](poker-games.md) lend themselves to variations, extra rules
that allow compounding a few new rules to make a game with a new, different feel.

Variations described here are for relatively rare games that don't reiterate
the rules of an existing game, but add a wrinkle that can be applied to
multiple games.

A variation that applies to only one game will be described on the page for
that game.

It's somewhat arbitrary to differentiate between a game and a variation, and we
haven't achieved consistency in this book.  For instance, high/low and
splot-pot are easily understood as variations that combine a couple games.  Or,
[triple-draw](deuce-to-seven-triple-draw.md) is a variation on
[single-draw](deuce-to-seven-lowball.md) games.

But this gets complicated when you try to describe a bunch of variations that
conspire to make something new.  For instance, if you know [Five-Card
Draw](five-card-draw.md), then we can describe [Badeucy](badeucy.md) as just
[five-card draw lowball](deuce-to-seven-lowball.md) played
[triple-draw](deuce-to-seven-triple-draw.md), [split-pot](split-pot.md), with a
[Badugi](badugi.md) high hand and a [deuce-to-seven](lowball-scales.md) low.

On the other hand, both [Big O](big-o.md) and [Five Card
Omaha](five-card-omaha.md) are both simple enough to describe as a variation:
Omaha, with five cards in hand instead of four.  For a few reasons, none
particularly consistent, they have their own game pages.

For clarity, and to highlight popular combinations, we usually re-state the
rules of the game rather than try to describe the variations that make up the
game.

However, some variations are simple enough to just explain in isolation.  This
is either because they are applied to multiple games, they are rare, or both.
This section is home to those.
