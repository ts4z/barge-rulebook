Common Rules and Variations
===========================

This section describes rules common to all games or some games, as well as a
few general variants played at BARGE.

In general, a host casino is assumed to use its own rulebook, which will cover
a lot of the same topics.  However, we do not know of any poker rooms that have
rules for games that involve dice (as of this writing).
