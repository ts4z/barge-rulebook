Deuce-to-Seven Razz
-------------------
### Forced Money

The game is played with antes. 

### Dealing Procedure

The high card on the board by rank first and then by suit brings it in. A♠ is
the highest possible card followed by the A♥, A♦, A♣, and so on.

Note: Because the game is played using Kansas City lowball rules, aces are always
high, so an ace is a high card for bring-in purposes.

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. Action starts with the lowest hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

It is required of each player that they do not alter or obfuscate the order in which
they have received their up cards.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card Kansas City low hand wins the pot.
