Action Razzdugi
---------------

### Forced Money
The game is played with antes. The high card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in. The K♠ is the highest possible card followed by the K♥, K♦,
K♣, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit. Action starts with the lowest hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best five-card [Action Razz](action-razz.md) hand and the best
(ace-to-four) [Badugi](badugi.md) hand split the pot. A face card is not
required to win the Badugi hand. There is no qualifier for either the Action
Razz or Badugi hand.  (Neither a "face" Action Razz hand, nor a 4-card Badugi
hand, are required.)
