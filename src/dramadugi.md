### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of betting.

Three community cards are placed face up. This is followed by a round of
betting. Then each player in turn discards zero to three cards from their
hand. Once all of the discards have been announced, the dealer will deal each
player an appropriate number of replacement cards.

One additional community card is placed face up, followed by a round of betting.

One additional community card is placed face up, followed by a round of
betting. This is followed by a showdown.

When played as [limit](limit.md), the first two betting rounds are at the
smaller limit, and the later two betting rounds are at the larger limit, as in
Omaha.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best Omaha high hand (using exactly two cards from the playerâ€™s hand and
exactly three cards from the board) and the best Badugi hand (using only the player's hole cards) split the pot.
