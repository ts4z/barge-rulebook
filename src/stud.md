Stud
----

Stud, also known as Seven-Card Stud, was a dominant game for many decades.

### Forced Money

The game is played with antes. The low card on the board by rank first and then
by suit brings it in. The 2♣ is the lowest possible card followed by the 2♦, 2♥,
2♠, and so on.

### Dealing Procedure

Starting with the player in seat one, each player is dealt two cards face down then
one card up, followed by a round of betting at the small bet limit,
starting with the player with the bring-in.

A second up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the small bet limit.  If a player shows an open pair a bet or raise may
optionally be a big bet (but see below). In this case a small bet can be met by a big bet raise. A
big bet may never be met with a small bet raise. Action starts with the highest
hand showing.

A third up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of betting
at the big bet limit.

A fourth up card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit.

A third down card is dealt to all active players. This is followed by a round of
betting at the big bet limit. This is followed by a showdown.

#### Double-Bet on Fourth Street

Historically, a bet at the higher limit was allowed on fourth street if any
player had an exposed pair.

However, many cardrooms no longer allow this, and it is not allowed in current
TDA rules.

### Evaluating the Showdown

The best high five-card hand wins the pot.
