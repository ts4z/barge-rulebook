BARGE Rulebook Redux
====================

This is my revision of the BARGE rulebook intended for a multi-author audience.

This is an attempt to produce readable input text, HTML, and PDF output from
one set of documents.

Markdown is an easy-to-edit but subtly ambiguous format that has become
popular.  This format has a few things going for it: it reads as text, so the
input format is readable and looks great in email; it renders to HTML well and
supports links; and it can be turned into LaTeX, which renders well on a
printed page.

In order to make this acceptable in terms of text representation, I've used
Github-Flavored Markdown, which allows for tables, footnotes, and other
niceities.

For the HTML version, a program needs to exisst that provides a usable table of
contents.  I wrote one that does a marginally acceptable job.

TBD: The LaTeX conversion is not easy, for reasons I don't understand.
